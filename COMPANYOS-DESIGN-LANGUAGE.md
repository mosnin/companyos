# LEDGER INSTRUMENT — The CompanyOS Web Design Language

**Version 1.0 · Contract specification · Implement literally.**

Every hex, pixel, duration and token name in this document is normative. Where a value is
given, use that value. Where a rule is stated as a prohibition, a violation of it is a
review failure, not a matter of taste. Every contrast ratio quoted has been computed, not
estimated; the numbers are reproducible from the hex values given.

## 1. NAME AND THESIS

**LEDGER INSTRUMENT.**

CompanyOS is version control for a company's business context. The interface is therefore
not an app that displays your company — it is an instrument you *read* your company off
of, and the thing it reads is a ledger. So the interface behaves like a well-made
measuring device bound as a ruled book: an almost invisible neutral chassis; a hard surface
ladder that tells you at a glance what is ground and what is an object; needles that are
the only coloured things on screen; and, wherever something has history, a revision rail
with commit nodes running down its left edge. Every number is tabular and sits next to its
own shape — a sparkline, a delta, a threshold band — so a value never appears without its
trend. Every identifier (content hash, sequence number, slug, endpoint, key prefix, branch
ref) is set in Geist Mono with positive tracking, because in a versioned system the string
*is* the truth and must be scannable character by character. Density is earned, never
assumed: a row is dense because every column is typed and icon-marked, the way the ForgeUI
log table is — not because we shrank the padding.

This language is held to four principles. They are ranked; when two conflict, the
lower-numbered one wins.

> **P1 — STRUCTURE IS MONOCHROME, SIGNAL IS COLOUR.**
> All structural chrome and all primary actions are near-black on white in light mode and
> near-white on near-black in dark mode. Hue enters the interface only as a value the user
> must decode. If you cannot finish the sentence *"this hue means \_\_\_"* with a noun from
> the domain — status, data series, delta, threshold, diff, validation — the hue does not
> ship. §4 enumerates every permitted use exhaustively; that list is closed.

> **P2 — THE GROUND IS BELOW, THE OBJECT IS ABOVE.**
> The page ground is a recessive neutral. Cards are pure white (light) or a lighter
> near-black (dark) and sit *above* it on a hairline plus a near-subliminal shadow. The
> current app inverts this — cards are `bg-muted/50`, *darker* than the page, with no
> border and no shadow — and that single inversion is most of why the product reads as an
> anonymous template. Correcting it is the highest-leverage change in this document.

> **P3 — HIERARCHY COMES FROM WEIGHT, SIZE AND SURFACE — NEVER FROM COLOUR, AND NEVER
> FROM MORE BORDERS.**
> To make one thing outrank another, change its weight (400→600), its size, or its rung on
> the surface ladder. Do not tint it. Do not add a rule around it. There are exactly three
> border weights (§5) and adding a fourth is a review failure.

> **P4 — ELEVATION IS EARNED, AND EMPTY IS DESIGNED.**
> A raised surface means "this is a distinct object", not "I wanted a box". And the
> zero-data rendering of every component is part of that component's specification, not a
> fallback discovered later — a company that has committed nothing must look finished, not
> broken. An empty gauge is still a gauge.

**What this language explicitly rejects:** coloured brand chrome; a blue active nav item,
tab underline or focus ring; coloured primary buttons; hero marketing rhythm inside the
app; gradients as decoration; illustration and mascots; oversized "friendly" empty states;
count-up number animations; card-in-card padding sprawl; eleven department hues; and lists
rendered as flex stacks of identical rounded grey rectangles.

## 2. SURFACES

### 2.1 The law

Elevation is distance from the canvas. **In light mode, raised moves toward white. In dark
mode, raised moves toward light.** Recessed always moves *toward* the canvas value and past
it. The page ground is never the brightest thing on screen in light mode and never the
lightest thing in dark mode.

Each rung has a verb, and the verb is what decides whether you may use it:

| Rung | Verb |
|---|---|
| `canvas` | **hosts** — everything scrolls on it |
| `rail` | **frames** — the persistent chassis |
| `raised` | **is an object** — you can act on it as a whole |
| `inset` | **is a cavity** — a well cut into a raised surface |
| `object` | **is a discrete thing inside a card** — a row that reads as separable without elevation |
| `overlay` | **is temporarily above** — it will disappear |

**ADJACENCY RULE.** A region surface may only be adjacent to a rung ±1 away. If you find
yourself putting an `inset` directly on the `canvas`, you have skipped a card. **Maximum
region nesting depth is `canvas → raised → (inset | object)`. Three fills. If a design
needs a fourth, the layout is wrong.**

**`--track` is not a rung.** Segmented-control tracks, meter tracks, progress tracks and
skeleton fills are *fills*, not regions, and may appear on any rung. They are darker than
every region in both modes so they read as recessed wherever they land. This is the one
exemption from the adjacency rule and it is exhaustive: nothing else claims it.

### 2.2 Tokens

--track:            #0A0B0E;
--surface-scrim:    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.62);
```

### 2.3 Rule per level

**`--surface-canvas` — the page ground.** Everything scrolls on it. It holds text directly
in exactly three cases: the page large-title block, sticky section/date group headers, and
the `label-caps` group heading that sits *above* a card. Nothing with a border sits flush
on it without a ≥16px gutter.

**`--surface-rail` — the chassis.** Left navigation sidebar, top bar, and the sticky commit
bar. It is a **peer** surface, not a floating panel: it takes a 1px `--line-hairline` on its
content-facing edge and **never casts a shadow onto the canvas, in either mode.** In light
it is deliberately the same `#FFFFFF` as a card — the sidebar reads as "the machine's
frame", cards read as "objects on the bench", and the grey canvas between them is what
separates the two. This is exactly what ForgeUI and all three Remote screens do. In dark it
is *darker* than a card (`#121419` vs `#191C21`), because chrome recedes.

**`--surface-raised` — the object.** Cards, panels, table containers, stat strips, chart
panels, right-rail cards, field-group cards, toasts, sheets, dialogs. This is the default
home for content. Always `1px solid var(--line-border)` + `--elev-1`. In dark it is
*lighter* than the canvas (1.124 luminance ratio) — that lightness **is** the elevation,
since a drop shadow is physically invisible on `#0D0F12`.

**`--surface-inset` — the cavity.** Table header rows, code/JSON wells, diff gutters, hash
chips, kbd caps, icon tiles (neutral), search fields, the collapsed-context row in a diff,
the active sidebar nav row, the table footer. Never a page ground. **Never nested inside
another inset.**

**`--surface-object` — the discrete inset row.** A row inside a card that must read as its
own separable thing without being elevated: right-rail summary rows, grouped-list rows in a
settings ledger, the capability rows in the members roster. Radius 12, `1px solid
var(--line-hairline)`, **no shadow, ever.** This is the Remote "Available leave" /
"Pending approval" box. Because its separation from the card is thin by design (1.042 light,
1.059 dark), **the hairline is load-bearing and may not be dropped.**

**`--surface-overlay` — the transient layer.** Dropdown menus, popovers, tooltips (see the
inverse exception below), chart hover cards, the command palette, dialogs, toasts. In light
it is the same white as a card and separation comes entirely from `--elev-2`/`--elev-3`; in
dark it steps one rung lighter than a card so a menu opened over a card is unambiguously
above it.

**`--surface-scrim` — behind modals only.** `backdrop-filter: blur(2px) saturate(0.9)`.
2px, not 12px: this is a scrim, not frosted glass.

**`--surface-inverse` — the micro-surface exception.** Tooltips and only tooltips invert:
light `#14161A` with `#FFFFFF` text, dark `#F2F4F6` with `#0D0F12` text. A tooltip must
read instantly against any rung it is thrown over, and inversion is the only treatment that
does that without colour.

### 2.4 State fills

Always alpha, never a hardcoded hex, so they composite correctly over every rung:

```css
--state-hover:    rgba(20,22,26,0.045);   /* dark: rgba(255,255,255,0.055) */
--state-active:   rgba(20,22,26,0.085);   /* dark: rgba(255,255,255,0.100) */
--state-selected: rgba(20,22,26,0.060);   /* dark: rgba(255,255,255,0.075) */
```

### 2.5 Lines — exactly three weights

A card and its internal dividers must never use the same weight. **There is no fourth
weight.** Adding one is a P3 violation.

```css
/* LIGHT */                      /* DARK */
--line-hairline: #E3E6EA;        --line-hairline: #282C33;
--line-border:   #D6DAE0;        --line-border:   #31353D;
--line-strong:   #C3C9D2;        --line-strong:   #3E434C;
```

- **`--line-hairline`** — dividers *inside* a card: table row separators, stat-strip
  vertical rules, grouped-list separators, chart gridlines (dashed), the `--surface-object`
  row border, the sidebar's section rules, the revision rail spine.
- **`--line-border`** — the outer edge of every raised surface, the sidebar's right edge,
  the top bar's bottom edge, inputs, secondary buttons, chips.
- **`--line-strong`** — hover borders on secondary controls, the chart crosshair,
  threshold ticks, drag handles, the active sortable-header underline, the neutral bar-chart
  fill.

### 2.6 The inversion being corrected

| | Today (wrong) | This spec (correct) |
|---|---|---|
| Page ground | `--background` `#ffffff` | `--surface-canvas` `#F4F5F7` |
| Card | `bg-muted/50` — **darker than the page** | `--surface-raised` `#FFFFFF` — **lighter than the page** |
| Card border | `border-border`, same as everything | `--line-border`, distinct from internal `--line-hairline` |
| Card shadow | none | `--elev-1`, a 1px micro-shadow |
| Sidebar | `bg-muted/50` — **identical fill to a card** | `--surface-rail`, a peer surface with an edge hairline |

`components/ui/card.tsx` shipping `rounded-lg border border-border bg-muted/50` while
`components/shell/app-shell.tsx` ships `bg-muted/50` on the `<aside>` is the single defect
this section exists to delete. **A card and the navigation chrome may never share a fill.**

---

## 3. TYPOGRAPHY

### 3.1 Faces

```css
--font-sans: var(--font-open-sans), ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", sans-serif;
--font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono), ui-monospace, "SF Mono", Menlo, monospace;
```

Two faces. There is no third, no display face, and no serif. `--font-serif` and
`--font-display` are **deleted** from the token set — they are currently aliased to Open
Sans, used nowhere, and advertised in the README as something the product does not have.

Weights used: **400, 500, 600, 650, 700.** Never 300, never ≥800.

### 3.2 The optical tracking rule

Tracking is a function of size, not a per-component whim. **This table is the authority.**
It supersedes any formula; do not interpolate with arithmetic, read the row.

| Size | Sans tracking | Uppercase adds | Mono tracking |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≥30px | −0.024em | *(caps forbidden ≥19px)* | 0em |
| 26–29px | −0.018em | — | 0em |
| 19–25px | −0.012em | — | 0em |
| 17–18px | −0.006em | — | 0em |
| 15–16px | −0.002em | — | 0em |
| 14px | 0em | +0.07em | 0em |
| 13px | +0.002em | +0.07em | 0em |
| 12px | +0.006em | +0.07em | +0.010em |
| 11px | +0.010em | +0.07em | +0.010em |

Three rules attach to this table and are non-negotiable:

1. **Geist Mono never takes negative tracking, at any size.** Negative tracking destroys
   the character-by-character scannability of a content hash, which is the only reason the
   mono face is in the product.
2. **Uppercase below 12px without positive tracking is a bug.** A caps label at 11px sets at
   `+0.010em + 0.07em = +0.080em`.
3. **11px is the floor for uppercase.** There is no 10px and no 9px caps role. The current
   codebase ships `text-[9px] uppercase tracking-wider` for the registry's `start` marker
   and `text-[10px]` in four other places; all of them are deleted.

Mono set inline inside Open Sans prose renders at `font-size: 0.92em` so the x-heights
match. Standalone mono uses its literal px size.

### 3.3 The numeric rule

`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums lining-nums` and `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1,
"lnum" 1` are **mandatory** on: every table numeric column, every KPI value, every delta,
every meter readout, every timestamp, every revision sequence number, every content hash,
every token count, every chart axis label, and every count inside a chip or badge.

**The one carve-out: non-tabular numerals are permitted only inside running prose** (a
document's `body-read` text, a paragraph of help copy). Tabular figures inside a sentence
are wrong.

A column of numbers that does not align on the digit is a defect, not a nitpick.

### 3.4 The scale

| Role | px | Weight | Line-height | Tracking | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `display` | 32 | 700 | 38px | −0.024em | The one large title on ATLAS, LEDGER STREAM, REGISTRY and BLANK SLATE. Collapses into the top bar on scroll. |
| `title-1` | 26 | 650 | 32px | −0.018em | Dialog titles, BLANK SLATE headline, SEQUENCE DETAIL header, GENESIS SHEET headline. |
| `title-2` | 22 | 650 | 28px | −0.012em | Page large-title on every route that does not own `display`. Document H1 in the reader. |
| `title-compact` | 15 | 650 | 20px | −0.002em | The collapsed page title inside the 52px top bar. |
| `title-3` | 19 | 650 | 26px | −0.012em | Card titles, panel titles, right-rail card heading, chart panel title, section headings. |
| `title-4` | 16 | 600 | 22px | −0.006em | Sub-section headings, field-group names, empty-state titles, date-group titles. |
| `body-read` | 15 | 400 | 25px | −0.002em | Document prose in the reader and editor **only**. Measure capped at 68ch / 720px. |
| `body` | 14 | 400 | 20px | 0em | Default UI text: table cells, form values, menu items, descriptions. |
| `body-strong` | 14 | 600 | 20px | 0em | Line 1 of a two-line table cell, list-row titles, tab labels, md/lg button labels, toast titles, commit messages. |
| `caption` | 13 | 400 | 18px | +0.002em | Line 2 of two-line cells, helper text, chart axis labels, author names, meta strings, breadcrumbs, empty-state body. |
| `caption-strong` | 13 | 600 | 18px | +0.002em | Filter-chip labels, segmented-control items, sm button labels, rail-card link actions. |
| `micro` | 12 | 500 | 16px | +0.006em | Table footer counts, tooltips, badge text, `vs prev 30d` suffixes, pagination, legend labels. |
| `label-caps` | 11 | 650 | 14px | **+0.080em**, `text-transform: uppercase` | Sidebar section labels, table column headers, stat-strip captions, field labels, rail-card row labels, result-group headers, diff hunk field names. **This is the only uppercase role in the product.** |
| **Numeric** | | | | | *(all carry `tabular-nums lining-nums`)* |
| `metric-xl` | 30 | 650 | 34px | −0.024em | The headline number in a stat-strip cell. |
| `metric-lg` | 22 | 650 | 26px | −0.012em | Right-rail summary values, run-economics headline, SEQUENCE DETAIL sequence number. |
| `metric-md` | 17 | 600 | 24px | −0.006em | Meter readouts, inline emphasised numbers. |
| `metric-sm` | 13 | 600 | 18px | +0.002em | In-table numbers, delta values, threshold values, chart tooltip values. |
| **Mono** | | | | | *(Geist Mono)* |
| `mono-hash` | 12 | 500 | 16px | +0.010em | 7-character content hashes, agent-key prefixes, document slugs, MCP endpoint fragments, run ids. |
| `mono-hash-lg` | 13 | 500 | 20px | 0em | The full 40-character hash on a revision detail surface. |
| `mono-seq` | 12 | 600 | 16px | +0.010em | Revision sequence numbers, rendered zero-padded to four digits. Diff `+n / −m` counts. |
| `mono-code` | 13 | 400 | 20px | 0em | Code blocks, MCP request/response snippets, endpoint paths, diff row content, JSON payloads. |
| `mono-micro` | 11 | 500 | 14px | +0.010em | Diff gutter line numbers, kbd glyphs, agent avatar codes, department codes. |

### 3.5 The identifier discipline

Three rules, because in this product the identifier is the evidence.

1. **Sequence numbers are zero-padded to four digits and prefixed with `#`:** `#0007`,
   `#0142`, `#1608`. Beyond `#9999` the number grows and the column widens. In a table they
   occupy a **fixed 56px right-aligned column**. They **never wrap, never truncate and never
   abbreviate — the layout yields to them.** A column of revisions must read as a straight
   edge down the page.
2. **Content hashes render at exactly 7 characters** in a `HashChip` (§9), with the full
   value in the tooltip and on copy. A revision-detail surface renders the full 40 in
   `mono-hash-lg`. A hash is never truncated with an ellipsis and never rendered in body
   text colour.
3. **`revisionCount` of 0 renders as `0`, not as an absence.** Absence of a count and a
   count of zero are different facts in a versioned system. The current code renders
   `· r{seq}` only when `seq` is truthy, collapsing revision 0 and `null` into the same
   nothing; that is a data-integrity bug expressed as a layout.

### 3.6 Text colour ramp

Hierarchy decays down this ramp. Colour **never** marks category — only importance.

```css
/* LIGHT */                       /* DARK */
--text-primary:    #14161A;       --text-primary:    #F2F4F6;
--text-secondary:  #4C535E;       --text-secondary:  #A6AEBA;
--text-tertiary:   #5C6470;       --text-tertiary:   #8A93A0;
--text-quaternary: #848C99;       --text-quaternary: #656D79;
--text-inverse:    #FFFFFF;       --text-inverse:    #0D0F12;
```

- `--text-primary` — titles, metric values, table line 1, active nav, document prose.
- `--text-secondary` — body, column header labels, inactive tabs, secondary button labels.
- `--text-tertiary` — meta, table line 2, captions, axis labels, default icon colour,
  **and every em-dash "no data" value.**
- `--text-quaternary` — **non-informational only**: placeholders, disabled labels,
  breadcrumb separators, unsorted sort chevrons, the empty-tree glyph. It may never be the
  sole carrier of meaning, and it is **never used on `--surface-overlay`** (use tertiary
  there).

**Measured.** `--text-tertiary` clears 4.5:1 on *every* surface it can land on, including
the darkest (`--track`): light 4.92 → 5.98, dark 4.88 → 6.34. `--text-secondary`: 6.38 →
8.79. `--text-quaternary` clears 3:1 on canvas, card and inset in both modes (3.03 → 3.67).
Section 12 restates the full matrix.

---

## 4. COLOUR

### 4.1 THE RULE

> **Structural chrome and primary actions are MONOCHROME.** Near-black on white in light
> mode; near-white on near-black in dark mode. **Colour appears only as functional signal —
> a value the user must decode.**

"Structural chrome" means, exhaustively: the page ground, cards, the sidebar, the top bar,
all borders and dividers, **buttons of every variant except one**, the active nav item, the
tab underline, the focus ring, the selection fill, links, checkboxes, radios, switches,
icon tiles in their default state, avatars, scrollbars, and all typography.

If a colour cannot be given a one-word job — *status, series, delta, threshold, diff,
validation* — it does not ship.

### 4.2 Monochrome action tokens

```css
/* PRIMARY BUTTON — light */            /* dark */
--action-fill:        #14161A;          #F2F4F6;
--action-label:       #FFFFFF;          #0D0F12;
--action-fill-hover:  #262A31;          #FFFFFF;
--action-fill-active: #000000;          #D9DCE1;

/* FOCUS — monochrome, in both modes */
--focus-ring:         #14161A;          #F2F4F6;

/* SELECTION */
--selection:  rgba(20,22,26,0.14);      rgba(242,244,246,0.20);
```

Primary button label contrast: **18.11:1** light, **17.41:1** dark.

**Links in prose** — because "no blue links" is an unfinished rule without a replacement:

```css
color: var(--text-primary);
text-decoration: underline;
text-underline-offset: 3px;
text-decoration-thickness: 1px;
text-decoration-color: rgba(20,22,26,0.28);   /* dark: rgba(242,244,246,0.32) */
```
On hover the decoration goes to full ink. Links are never blue, and links in **chrome**
(nav rows, breadcrumbs, card header actions) carry no underline at all — they are ordinary
rows with hover fills.

### 4.3 Semantic signal roles

Each role ships four values: `-text` (AA-legible on canvas, card and its own wash), `-mark`
(chroma-forward, for dots, strokes, fills and glyphs; clears 3:1 as a graphical object),
`-wash` (a low-alpha background), `-border`.

```css
/* ---------------- LIGHT ---------------- */
--positive-text:  #0F6E3B;  --positive-mark:  #14874A;
--positive-wash:  rgba(20,135,74,0.10);   --positive-border: rgba(20,135,74,0.28);
--caution-text:   #875100;  --caution-mark:   #B87708;
--caution-wash:   rgba(184,119,8,0.12);   --caution-border:  rgba(184,119,8,0.32);
--critical-text:  #AE2217;  --critical-mark:  #CC3227;

--info-wash:      rgba(12,138,147,0.10);  --info-border:     rgba(12,138,147,0.28);
--neutral-mark:   #98A0AC;  --neutral-wash:   rgba(20,22,26,0.06);
                            /* --neutral-text = --text-tertiary */

/* ---------------- DARK ----------------- */
--positive-text:  #49D07F;  --positive-mark:  #2FBE6B;
--positive-wash:  rgba(47,190,107,0.16);  --positive-border: rgba(47,190,107,0.30);
--caution-text:   #F0B44A;  --caution-mark:   #E3A02B;
--caution-wash:   rgba(227,160,43,0.16);  --caution-border:  rgba(227,160,43,0.30);
--critical-text:  #FF867C;  --critical-mark:  #EF5A4C;
--critical-wash:  rgba(239,90,76,0.16);   --critical-border: rgba(239,90,76,0.32);
--agent-text:     #B79FFF;  --agent-mark:     #9A79F2;
--agent-wash:     rgba(154,121,242,0.16); --agent-border:    rgba(154,121,242,0.30);
--info-text:      #4FD0D8;  --info-mark:      #29B4BE;
--info-wash:      rgba(41,180,190,0.16);  --info-border:     rgba(41,180,190,0.28);
--neutral-mark:   #6B7480;  --neutral-wash:   rgba(255,255,255,0.08);
```

**Job of each role — the only meanings these hues carry:**

| Role | Job |
|---|---|
| `positive` | head revision · merged branch · succeeded run · accepted receipt · healthy threshold band · good-direction delta · diff-add |
| `caution` | uncommitted/dirty field · open branch · draft document · key expiring <7d · stale beyond cadence · warn threshold band · run in progress |
| `critical` | failed run · revoked or expired key · merge conflict · bad-direction delta · diff-remove · breached threshold · validation error · destructive confirmation |
| `agent` | agent-issued key · agent-authored revision · MCP lane · agent identity tile · the `run_event` marker |
| `info` | the `in review` document state · the second chart series. **Teal, deliberately not blue**, so no mark can be mistaken for a link or a brand accent. |
| `neutral` | archived · closed · not started · no data · not applicable |

**`agent` violet marks machine origin and nothing else.** It does **not** double as the
`draft` document state (which would make a violet dot ambiguous between "an agent wrote
this" and "this is unpublished"). `draft` takes `caution`; agent origin also carries a
*shape* distinction (§5.3) so it survives greyscale.

**Measured, every value.** All ten `-text` values clear 4.5:1 on card, canvas *and* their
own wash (light 5.57–8.08, dark 5.99–10.37). All ten `-mark` values clear 3:1 as graphical
objects (light 3.39–5.57, dark 5.07–7.59).

### 4.4 Data-series palette

```css
/* light */                    /* dark */
--series-1: #383D46;           #DDE1E7;   /* GRAPHITE — always the headline series */
--series-2: #0C8A93;           #29B4BE;   /* teal */
--series-3: #7346E8;           #9A79F2;   /* violet */
--series-4: #B87708;           #E3A02B;   /* amber */
```

**`--series-1` is monochrome, so a one-series chart is entirely monochrome.** Hue enters a
chart only when a second series must be told apart from the first. This is the sharpest
expression of P1 in the system, and it also repairs a genuine ambiguity in the ForgeUI
reference, where green is simultaneously the *Deployments* series and the *positive delta*.

**`positive` green and `critical` red are RESERVED and may never be assigned as series
colours.** A green or red mark inside a plot therefore always means good/bad, never
"series 3". A fifth series is not permitted — group the tail into "Other" at
`--neutral-mark`.

**Departments are never colour-coded.** Eleven hues would collide with the six-role status
vocabulary and become decoration. See §8 for how departments are identified instead.

### 4.5 Diff palette — the only tinted *content* surfaces

```css
/* ------------- LIGHT ------------- */          /* ------------- DARK ------------- */
--diff-add-bg:      #E7F4EC;                     #143524;
--diff-add-strong:  #C9E9D6;   /* intra-line */  #1E5238;
--diff-add-gutter:  #BCE3CD;                     #22603F;
--diff-add-ink:     #0F5D34;                     #7EE0AC;
--diff-del-bg:      #FBEAE8;                     #3F1D19;
--diff-del-strong:  #F6D3CF;                     #5C2A24;
--diff-del-gutter:  #F0C8C4;                     #6B322B;
--diff-del-ink:     #8F1C13;                     #FFA9A1;
--diff-move-bg:     #F0EBFC;                     #2A2444;
--diff-move-gutter: #D9CDF4;                     #3E3566;
--diff-move-ink:    #4A2A9E;                     #CBB8FD;
--diff-context:     transparent;                 transparent;
```

Measured: ink-on-row-background 7.04–8.50 (light), 8.17–8.40 (dark); every row background
separates from the card by ≥1.13 (light) and ≥1.14 (dark). *(An earlier candidate dark
delete tint sat at 1.005 against the card — invisible. The value above is the corrected
one.)*

**Diff colour is always doubled with position.** Every added line carries a `+` glyph and a
3px left gutter bar; every removed line carries `−` and its bar. Roughly 8% of male users
cannot separate the two hues, and the markers — not the tints — are what make the diff
readable to them. Removing the markers "for cleanliness" is a review failure.

### 4.6 The exhaustive list of permitted colour

Nothing outside this list. **The list is closed: adding an entry requires removing one.**

1. Status dots (6px / 8px / 10px) and status pills.
2. Data-series strokes, area gradients, bar fills, hover dots and legend swatches inside a
   chart plot, its legend, or a sparkline.
3. Delta indicators: the ▲/▼ glyph and its numeral.
4. Threshold-banded numeric **values** — `85ms` green / `250ms` amber / `420ms` red — applied
   here to tokens-per-accepted-receipt, key days-to-expiry, document freshness against
   cadence, and completeness bands.
5. Diff add / remove / move: the gutter bar, the row background, the `+`/`−` glyph, and the
   intra-line `<mark>`.
6. Diff summary counts (`+128` positive, `−41` critical) and the 5-block stat bar.
7. Meter fill **only when the meter encodes a threshold**. A meter showing neutral progress
   (document completeness, upload progress) fills with `--text-primary`, monochrome.
8. Commit-node state on the revision rail: head = `positive`, branch ring = `agent`,
   conflicted ring = `critical`; every other node is `--text-tertiary`.
9. Agent origin: the agent identity tile's `--agent-wash` ground and `--agent-text` glyph.
10. Form validation: the error message text and the 1px input border in the error state; a
    `positive` check on async success.
11. Banner / callout: the 3px left rule and the leading icon, for the six roles.
12. Destructive affordances: `--critical-text` on ghost destructive buttons and menu items;
    and a **solid** `--critical` fill on exactly one element in the entire product — the
    confirm button inside a destructive confirmation dialog.
13. Toast leading icon.
14. The unread/notification dot: 6px `--critical-mark` with a 1.5px `--surface-rail` halo.
15. Text selection (`--selection`, monochrome — listed for completeness).

### 4.7 Explicitly forbidden

Coloured primary buttons · a coloured sidebar active state (it is `--surface-inset` + a 2px
**monochrome** left bar) · a coloured tab underline (2px `--text-primary`) · a coloured
focus ring · coloured filter-chip selection (selection is an inverted monochrome fill) ·
tinted icon tiles that carry no state · coloured links in chrome · gradients as decoration ·
brand-tinted page or card backgrounds · hue distinguishing one department from another · a
raw hex literal or a `bg-blue-*`-style utility anywhere under `app/**`.

### 4.8 Enforcement

The rule survives contact with a stakeholder only if it is mechanical:

1. **Signal tokens are unavailable at the CSS-variable layer** to the `Button`, `NavRow`,
   `Tab`, `FilterChip` and focus-ring components. Not discouraged in prose — *not in scope*.
2. Ship **no raw hue tokens at all.** Colour is exposed exclusively as
   `--{positive|caution|critical|agent|info|neutral}-{text|mark|wash|border}`,
   `--series-{1..4}` and `--diff-*`. If a hue has no semantic token name, it cannot be typed.
3. A lint rule rejects hex literals and Tailwind palette utilities (`bg-blue-500`,
   `text-emerald-600`, …) under `app/**` and `components/**`.

## 5. SHAPE AND ELEVATION

### 5.1 The radius principle

Radius is semantics, not decoration. It is what lets the eye sort a monochrome interface
without hue:

> **Pill = "act on me." Rounded rectangle = "read me." Square = "compare me."**

Controls that get pressed are fully round. Containers that hold content are rounded rects
at 10–20. Anything that is a grid of data is square at 0–8, because a grid of rounded cells
reads as a toy.

### 5.2 Radius scale

```css
--r-0: 0px;  --r-2: 2px;  --r-4: 4px;  --r-6: 6px;  --r-8: 8px;
--r-10: 10px; --r-12: 12px; --r-14: 14px; --r-16: 16px; --r-20: 20px;
--r-full: 9999px;
```

| Token | Applied to |
|---|---|
| `--r-0` | Table cells and rows, diff rows and gutters, chart plot edges, full-bleed dividers, sticky date headers, the rail spine, hunk headers. |
| `--r-2` | Sparkline bar caps, meter fills ≤4px tall, diff gutter bars, chart legend swatches (12×3), the 2px selection bar. |
| `--r-4` | Checkbox, skeleton text bars, kbd caps, inline mono tokens inside prose, table-cell micro-tags, hash chips. |
| `--r-6` | Inputs 28–32px, sm/xs buttons, icon buttons 28px, menu and palette rows, table-row hover fill, the agent square avatar, the agent commit node. |
| `--r-8` | Buttons 36px, icon tiles 28px, sidebar nav rows, popovers, dropdown menus, code wells, the commit-message input, canvas dropzones. |
| `--r-10` | Icon tiles 32px, right-rail cards, `--surface-object` rows, quick-action cards at compact size, standalone stat cells, small toasts. |
| `--r-12` | **The default object radius.** Cards, panels, table containers, stat strips, chart panels, `--surface-object` grouped rows, banners, tooltips, icon tiles 40px. |
| `--r-14` | Large containers in dense contexts: the data-table container, the document reading column, icon tiles 48px. |
| `--r-16` | Page-level cards, quick-action cards, media tiles, task-row cards, the empty-state panel, right-rail summary cards. |
| `--r-20` | Dialogs, sheets, drawers, the command palette. **Nothing in the product is rounder than 20 except pills.** |
| `--r-full` | All buttons, filter chips, status pills, count badges, segmented-control track *and* thumb, search fields, human avatars, pagination controls, switches, meter tracks and fills. |

### 5.3 The two shape rules that carry meaning

**HUMAN / MACHINE.** Human identity is a **fully round** avatar. Agent identity is a
**rounded square** (`--r-6` at 24px, `--r-8` at 28px+) on `--agent-wash`. Round means
person, square means process. On the revision rail this extends to the node itself: a
human commit is a **circle**, an agent commit is a **rounded square** at the same optical
size. This distinction is load-bearing across the timeline, revision history, run detail
and key detail, and — crucially — **it works with colour removed**, which colour-only
authorship marking does not.

**THE RAIL EXCEPTION.** Any row that abuts the revision rail is square on the edge that
touches the spine and rounded on the other: `border-radius: 0 var(--r-8) var(--r-8) 0`. The
row yields its edge so the spine reads as a continuous bound edge rather than a series of
interrupted arcs.

### 5.4 Nesting and overflow

**Concentric radius rule:** `inner = outer − padding`, floored at `--r-4`. A 12-radius card
with 16px padding takes `--r-0`/`--r-4` children, not another 12. An inner radius may never
exceed its outer. Concentric mismatch is the fastest way to make a dense UI look cheap.

**Icon-tile ratio:** radius ≈ 0.30 × size — 28→8, 32→10, 40→12, 48→14. This reads as a
superellipse without an SVG squircle, and it means a new tile size derives its own radius
instead of drifting.

**Overflow:** a table inside a 14-radius card sets `overflow: hidden` on the card so the
first header row and last footer row clip correctly; the header's own corners stay `--r-0`.
Segmented thumbs, chips and pills never clip. A sticky table header keeps its top corners
only while `scrollTop === 0`, then flattens to `--r-0` as the sticky shadow appears.

### 5.5 Stroke widths

Icon strokes: **1.5px** at 16–20px, **1.25px** at 14px, **2px** at ≥24px. Hairlines are
exactly 1px and never scale — where a 1px border would be eaten by a `transform`, use an
inset `box-shadow` instead.

### 5.6 What earns elevation — exactly three qualifications

1. It is a distinct addressable **object** the user can act on as a whole (card, table
   container, panel, right-rail card, stat strip).
2. It is a **transient layer** over content (menu, popover, tooltip, dialog, palette, toast).
3. It has **left the flow** and now overlaps scrolling content (sticky top bar, sticky table
   header, sticky commit bar).

### 5.7 What does NOT earn elevation — enforce as review failures

- **Sections inside a card.** Use a 1px `--line-hairline` rule, never a nested card.
- **Stat-strip cells.** They are divided by **vertical rules inside one `--elev-1`
  container** — never four separately-shadowed boxes with gaps. This is the single most
  identifiable structural signature of the language, taken directly from the ForgeUI KPI
  row.
- **The sidebar.** A peer surface with a right hairline. It never casts a shadow onto the
  canvas in either mode. A shadowed sidebar reads as a drawer; this one is permanent.
- **Table rows.** Hover changes background only.
- **`--surface-object` rows.** Flat, hairlined, never shadowed.
- Chips, pills, badges, segmented items, tabs, status dots, meters, sparklines, diff rows,
  nav items, icon tiles.

**Maximum stacking depth in the product: `canvas → elev-1 → elev-2`** (a menu opened from a
card). `elev-3` always sits on a scrim, never on another elevated surface.

### 5.8 Elevation tokens

**LIGHT.** Elevation is a hairline plus a whisper of shadow. Shadow colour is always the ink
hue, never pure black — black shadows on a warm-neutral ground read muddy.

```css
--elev-0: none;                       /* + 1px solid var(--line-hairline) where separating */
--elev-1: 0 1px 0 0 rgba(20,22,26,0.03),
          0 1px 2px -1px rgba(20,22,26,0.10);          /* + 1px solid var(--line-border) */
--elev-1-hover: 0 1px 0 0 rgba(20,22,26,0.04),
          0 2px 4px -2px rgba(20,22,26,0.12);          /* + 1px solid var(--line-strong) */
--elev-2: 0 2px 4px -2px rgba(20,22,26,0.10),
          0 6px 16px -6px rgba(20,22,26,0.14);         /* + 1px solid var(--line-border) */
--elev-3: 0 12px 32px -12px rgba(20,22,26,0.24),
          0 2px 8px -2px rgba(20,22,26,0.10);          /* + 1px solid var(--line-border) */
--elev-sticky: 0 1px 0 0 var(--line-border),
          0 4px 8px -6px rgba(20,22,26,0.10);
--elev-sticky-up: 0 -1px 0 0 var(--line-border),
          0 -4px 12px -8px rgba(20,22,26,0.14);
```

**DARK.** A drop shadow is physically invisible against `#0D0F12`, so elevation is carried
by **a lighter surface + a 1px border + a 1px inset top highlight** — the highlight is what
makes a dark card read as a physical plane catching light from above. The drop shadow is
retained only under overlays, as a separating haze.

```css
--elev-0: none;                       /* + 1px solid var(--line-hairline) */
--elev-1: inset 0 1px 0 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.04);      /* + 1px solid var(--line-border) */
--elev-1-hover: inset 0 1px 0 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.06);/* + 1px solid var(--line-strong),
                                                           background lifts to #1E2127 */
--elev-2: inset 0 1px 0 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.06),
          0 8px 24px -8px rgba(0,0,0,0.60);            /* + 1px solid var(--line-strong) */
--elev-3: inset 0 1px 0 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.07),
          0 24px 60px -20px rgba(0,0,0,0.75);          /* + 1px solid var(--line-strong) */
--elev-sticky: 0 1px 0 0 var(--line-border);           /* hairline only — a dark drop
                                                           shadow under a sticky header
                                                           only muddies */
--elev-sticky-up: 0 -1px 0 0 var(--line-border);
```

**Dark mode has two cues, not one.** Card-to-canvas separation is 1.124 and overlay-to-card
is 1.127, but on a low-quality panel at 30% brightness those steps can flatten — so the 1px
border and the inset highlight are both mandatory and neither may be treated as optional
decoration.

**Hover elevation is an affordance claim, not a flourish.** `--elev-1 → --elev-1-hover`
happens **only on cards that navigate or drag**. A stat-strip cell, a KPI card and a static
panel do not lift, because you cannot click them. And a card that does lift changes
`box-shadow` and `border-color` only — **no `translateY`.** Cards sharpen; they do not
levitate.

**Focus never uses shadow as elevation.** It draws a two-stop ring that survives on every
rung:

```css
box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--surface-raised), 0 0 0 4px var(--focus-ring);
```

On a `--surface-inset`, `--track` or `--surface-canvas` ground, the **first** stop swaps to
that ground's token so the offset gap actually reads.

### 5.9 Z-index ladder

`content 0 · rail-overlay lines 5 · sticky header 10 · sticky commit bar 20 · sidebar 30 ·
dropdown & popover 100 · dialog scrim 200 · dialog 210 · command palette 300 · toast 400.`

---

## 6. SPACING AND GRID

### 6.1 The 4pt scale

```css
--s-1:  2px;   --s-2:  4px;   --s-3:  6px;   --s-4:  8px;
--s-5: 12px;   --s-6: 16px;   --s-7: 20px;   --s-8: 24px;
--s-9: 32px;   --s-10: 40px;  --s-11: 48px;  --s-12: 64px;
```

Every margin, padding and gap in the product is one of these twelve values. **A hardcoded
spacing value that is not on the scale is a review failure.** (6px and 2px exist because
icon-to-label gaps and hairline offsets genuinely need a sub-4 step; nothing else may use
them.)

### 6.2 Vertical rhythm inside a card

This is the operational half of "hierarchy comes from space", and it lets a reviewer catch
a violation without measuring:

| Between | Gap |
|---|---|
| A heading and its content | **16px** |
| Two sibling blocks | **12px** |
| A label and its value | **8px** |
| Two lines of the same cell | **4px** |
| A field's control and its helper/error text | **6px** |

### 6.3 Containers and grid

```css
--page-max:      1440px;   /* content column ceiling */
--prose-max:      720px;   /* 68ch — document reading measure */
--sidebar-w:      264px;   /* collapsed: 64px */
--rail-w:         320px;   /* right rail: min 280, max 360 */
--facet-w:        200px;   /* in-page facet column (registry) */
--header-h:        52px;   /* top bar */
--commitbar-h:     64px;
--rail-gutter:     28px;   /* the revision rail grid track */
```

Page gutter: **16px** below 768 · **24px** from 768 to 1599 · **32px** at ≥1600.
Layout grid: **12 columns, 24px gutter.**

**One measure, owned by the shell.** `<main>` sets the container; **no page may declare its
own `mx-auto max-w-*`.** The current app has six different measures across eleven pages
(`max-w-md`, `-xl`, `-2xl`, `-3xl`, `-4xl`, `-5xl`), each `mx-auto` inside a main that is
already offset by a 16rem sidebar, so the text column visibly jumps left and right on every
navigation. Archetypes (§10) choose between exactly three container modes, and the shell
implements them:

- `measure="prose"` → 720px centred
- `measure="page"` → 1440px centred *(default)*
- `measure="bleed"` → full width minus gutters

### 6.4 Density tiers

Two tiers only, exposed as a segmented control wherever a table offers it. There is no
third.

| | Comfortable *(default)* | Compact |
|---|---|---|
| Table row (two-line) | 56px | 40px, line 2 collapses into a hover tooltip |
| Table row (single-line) | 44px | 36px |
| Cell padding | 12px 16px | 8px 12px |
| Nav row | 34px | *(not offered)* |
| Grouped-list row | 56px with tile / 44px label-value | *(not offered)* |

### 6.5 Hit targets

**28px minimum** in dense contexts (table row actions, toolbar icon buttons, rail controls).
**36px** default. **44px** for primary actions and on coarse pointers.

Where the visual box is smaller than the required target, expand it with an invisible
`::before { position:absolute; inset:-8px }` — **never by growing the visual box.** Density
and touch-safety are not in conflict; they are solved in different layers.

---

## 7. MOTION

Motion exists to explain a change of state or position. **If nothing moved, nothing
animates.**

### 7.1 Durations

```css
--dur-1:  90ms;   /* pure state: hover fill, focus ring, text-colour step, row highlight, value crossfade */
--dur-2: 140ms;   /* THE DEFAULT. Disclosure, tab underline travel, segmented thumb, chip toggle,
                     card elev-1→hover, sort-arrow swap, chevron rotation */
--dur-3: 200ms;   /* layer entry: dropdown, popover, tooltip, toast, rail push, meter fill */
--dur-4: 260ms;   /* dialog, command palette, sheet, drawer, full-screen focus route */
--dur-chart: 300ms; /* chart path draw — FIRST MOUNT ONLY */
--dur-rail:  420ms; /* revision-rail draw-in — FIRST MOUNT ONLY, see 7.3 */
```

**Exit rule:** every exit runs at **0.6×** its entry, floored at 100ms. A dropdown enters in
200ms and leaves in 120ms; a dialog enters in 260ms and leaves in 160ms. Things arrive
deliberately and leave immediately.

### 7.2 Easings

```css
--ease-out:      cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1);  /* entries, expansion, meter fill, chart draw */
--ease-in:       cubic-bezier(0.40, 0.00, 1.00, 1);  /* exits, only */
--ease-move:     cubic-bezier(0.40, 0.00, 0.20, 1);  /* SYMMETRIC: an element travelling between two
                                                        positions that are BOTH on screen —
                                                        segmented thumb, tab underline, drag reorder */
--ease-emphasis: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0.00, 1);  /* dialogs, sheets, palette, focus routes */
--ease-linear:   linear;                             /* hover fills, opacity-only crossfades, spinner */
```

`--ease-move` is separate from `--ease-out` on purpose: when both endpoints are visible, an
asymmetric decelerating curve looks like the element is falling into place rather than
sliding to it.

**No springs. No overshoot. No bounce. An instrument's needle does not wobble.**

### 7.3 What animates, precisely

- **Segmented thumb** — `transform: translateX()` + `width`, `--dur-2 --ease-move`. The
  label colour crossfades over `--dur-1`. **The track never moves.**
- **Tab underline** — one absolutely-positioned 2px bar animating `transform` + `width`,
  `--dur-2 --ease-move`. Never per-tab borders.
- **Disclosure** (sidebar groups, field groups, diff hunks, date groups) —
  `grid-template-rows: 0fr → 1fr` + opacity, `--dur-2 --ease-move`; chevron
  `rotate(0 → 90deg)` on the same curve. **Never animate `height: auto`.**
- **Menu / popover / tooltip** — `opacity 0→1`, `translateY(-4px)→0`, `scale(0.98)→1`,
  `--dur-3 --ease-out`, `transform-origin` at the trigger edge. Exit 120ms `--ease-in`,
  opacity and scale only.
- **Dialog / palette** — scrim `opacity 0→1` `--dur-3` linear; panel `scale(0.97)→1` +
  `translateY(8px)→0` `--dur-4 --ease-emphasis`. Exit 160ms.
- **Sheet / drawer** — `translateX(100%)→0` (or `translateY` on mobile), `--dur-4
  --ease-emphasis`.
- **Toast** — enter `translateY(12px)→0` + opacity `--dur-3 --ease-out`; exit `opacity` +
  `translateX(-8px)` 120ms. Auto-dismiss 5000ms (8000ms with an action; `critical` never
  auto-dismisses), paused on hover or focus-within.
- **Table row hover** — `background-color` `--dur-1 --ease-linear`. No transform, no border
  change, no scale.
- **Card hover** (navigating cards only) — `box-shadow` + `border-color` `--dur-2
  --ease-out`. **No `translateY`.**
- **Large-title collapse** — driven **continuously by scroll position 0→48px**, not by a
  discrete threshold: the `display`/`title-2` title interpolates `opacity 1→0` and
  `translateY 0→-6px` while `title-compact` in the top bar does the inverse. Implement with
  a single `rAF`-throttled scroll handler writing one CSS custom property
  (`--title-collapse: 0..1`) that both elements read, or with `animation-timeline: scroll()`
  where supported. The sticky shadow is a separate, discrete change driven by an
  **IntersectionObserver sentinel**, not by the scroll handler.
- **Sticky shadow** — `box-shadow` + `opacity` 120ms linear, fired by an IntersectionObserver
  sentinel placed at the top of the scroll content. Never a scroll listener.
- **Meter fill** — `width` `--dur-3 --ease-out`, on mount and on value change. Indeterminate:
  a 30%-wide fill translating `-30% → 130%` over 1100ms `--ease-move` infinite.
- **Chart series** — path `stroke-dashoffset` draw over `--dur-chart --ease-out`, area fill
  `opacity 0→1` over 200ms delayed 120ms. **First mount only.** On a data change (range
  filter, refetch, tab return) the path **morphs via a 90ms opacity crossfade between the
  old and new `<path d>` — it never re-draws.** Re-drawing on every filter change is the
  single most annoying failure mode of hand-rolled charts.
- **Revision rail draw-in** — the one piece of ceremonial motion in the product, and the
  budget is exactly one: on **first mount** of LEDGER STREAM and the document history rail,
  the spine strokes in via `stroke-dashoffset` and the nodes fade + `scale(0.6→1)` staggered
  24ms each, **capped at the first 12 nodes**; the rest appear instantly. Never on re-sort,
  re-filter, pagination or route return.
- **Commit-node pulse** — after a successful commit the new head node emits **one** ring:
  `scale(1→1.9)`, `opacity 0.45→0`, 600ms `--ease-out`, single iteration. This is the only
  celebratory motion in the product.
- **Button loading** — the leading icon slot crossfades to a 14px, 2px-stroke, 270° arc
  spinning 700ms linear infinite. The label persists and `min-width` locks to the measured
  pre-click width so the layout does not jump.
- **Skeleton** — `opacity 1 → 0.62` over 1200ms `--ease-move` infinite alternate. **A pulse,
  not a travelling shimmer gradient** — a shimmer implies horizontal progress that does not
  exist, and on a 40-row table it is nauseating. **After 8 seconds the pulse stops and the
  skeleton holds static: a stuck request must look stuck rather than perpetually busy.**

### 7.4 What must NEVER animate

- **Numbers.** No count-up, no odometer. KPI values swap instantly. A counting animation
  makes a reading instrument lie for 800ms.
- **Route transitions.** Content appears; the chassis never moves. A version-control tool
  should feel like it already knows the answer.
- **Table sorting and filtering.** Instant re-render. No FLIP, no reorder animation — rows
  moving under the cursor in a dense ledger is a legibility failure.
- **Entrance staggers** on lists, cards or table rows (the rail draw-in in §7.3 is the sole,
  bounded exception).
- **The theme flip.** Applying `.dark` must not crossfade any element through a wrong-mode
  intermediate colour. Set `data-theme-switching` on `<html>` for one frame with
  `[data-theme-switching] * { transition: none !important; }`, flip the class, then remove
  the attribute on the next `requestAnimationFrame`.
- Anything on the canvas ground; icon morphs other than the chevron rotate.

### 7.5 Reduced motion

Under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`:

- All `transform` animations are removed — thumb, underline and panel entries jump to their
  end state.
- All durations clamp to `0.01ms` **except opacity crossfades, retained at 90ms**, so state
  changes remain perceptible.
- The chart draw and the rail draw-in are disabled entirely (final state paints immediately).
- The commit-node pulse is disabled.
- The skeleton pulse becomes a static `--track` fill.
- The indeterminate meter becomes a static full-width track at 40% opacity.
- The live status-dot pulse becomes a static ring.
- The large-title collapse becomes an instant swap at `scrollY > 24`.

Nothing becomes non-functional.

## 8. ICONOGRAPHY

### 8.1 Sizing and stroke

| Context | Size | Stroke |
|---|---|---|
| Dense table cell, meta line, chip | 14px | 1.25px |
| Nav row, button, menu item, header cell, tile (28–32px) | 16px | 1.5px |
| Sidebar section, tile 40px, banner, toast | 18–20px | 1.5px |
| Empty-state tile 48px, page-header identity | 24px | 2px |

One icon family, line style, consistently weighted. Default colour is `--text-tertiary`;
`--text-secondary` inside an active nav row or a hovered control; `--text-primary` when
active. An icon takes a signal colour **only** when it is one of the permitted uses in §4.6.

### 8.2 Semantic vs decorative — the ban

> **Every icon in the product must be either (a) the sole label of a control, or (b) a type
> marker that tells you what kind of thing a row is. There is no third reason to draw an
> icon. Decorative icons are forbidden.**

**Semantic (required):**
- Icon-only buttons — always with an `aria-label` and a 400ms-delay tooltip.
- The **type marker** at the head of a dense row: this is the ForgeUI move, where every
  column in the log table carries an icon so the row is scannable by shape before it is read.
  In CompanyOS this means the 12 `events.type` values, the document-kind marker, the field
  type (text / list / table / canvas), the run type, and the media MIME class.
- **Department glyphs** — see §8.3.
- Status glyphs inside banners and toasts.
- Disclosure chevrons, sort chevrons, the branch glyph, the copy glyph.

**Decorative (forbidden):** an icon beside a page title that just restates the title; an
icon in an empty state that is not the neutral 48px tile; a sparkle beside an AI action; a
"friendly" glyph in a card header; any icon whose removal would lose nothing.

**Never a raw emoji.** The current `⚠ unconverted spend` in `EconomicsStrip` is a defect in
a codebase that otherwise uses a single icon library; it becomes a `critical` Banner with a
16px glyph.

### 8.3 Department identity

With hue unavailable as a categorical device (§4.4), department identity is carried by two
things, and **the icon is never spent on anything else**:

1. **The glyph — mandatory, never replaced.** Eleven unique 16px line icons at 1.5px stroke:
   Landmark (business), Palette (brand), Megaphone (marketing), Handshake (sales), Package
   (product), Workflow (operations), Wallet (finance), Users (people), HeartHandshake
   (customer), Scale (legal), Cpu (technology). These currently live as a private
   `VIEW_ICONS` const inside `nav-sidebar.tsx`; they are promoted to a shared
   `DepartmentGlyph` primitive so the overview cards, the department header, the timeline
   lane mark, the search palette and the import target map can all use them.
2. **The code — a compact *label*, never a replacement for the glyph.** Three uppercase mono
   letters, `mono-micro` on `--surface-inset`: `BUS BRD MKT SLS PRD OPS FIN PPL CUS LEG TEC`.
   It is used **only where the full label does not fit**: a 24px chip inside a dense table
   row, the command-palette left gutter, the lane strip on an agent key. A row shows
   **glyph + code**; it never shows code alone.

Because `BUS`/`BRD`, `PRD`/`PPL` and `CUS`/`LEG` are collision risks, **any grouped display
of codes must carry a spelled-out department header above it**, so the code is learnable
rather than guessed. The code set is locked once and never regenerated per workspace.

---

## 9. COMPONENT VOCABULARY

### 9.0 Token bridge (`app/globals.css`)

Everything below references these names. Define the raw values on `:root` and
`:root.dark`, then bridge into Tailwind v4 with `@theme inline`. **Specificity — not source
order — is what makes the dark override win** (`:root.dark` is (0,2,0); `:root` is (0,1,0)),
so the blocks may appear in either order; put `@theme inline` last for readability.

```css
:root { /* …all values from §2, §3.6, §4, §5.8, §6.1, §7.1, §7.2… */ }
:root.dark { /* …dark overrides… */ }
[data-theme-switching] * { transition: none !important; }

@theme inline {
  /* surfaces */
  --color-canvas: var(--surface-canvas);
  --color-rail: var(--surface-rail);
  --color-raised: var(--surface-raised);
  --color-inset: var(--surface-inset);
  --color-object: var(--surface-object);
  --color-overlay: var(--surface-overlay);
  --color-inverse: var(--surface-inverse);
  --color-track: var(--track);
  /* lines */
  --color-hairline: var(--line-hairline);
  --color-border: var(--line-border);
  --color-strong: var(--line-strong);
  /* text */
  --color-ink: var(--text-primary);
  --color-ink-2: var(--text-secondary);
  --color-ink-3: var(--text-tertiary);
  --color-ink-4: var(--text-quaternary);
  --color-ink-inverse: var(--text-inverse);
  /* signals — the ONLY hue names that exist */
  --color-positive: var(--positive-mark);
  --color-positive-text: var(--positive-text);
  --color-positive-wash: var(--positive-wash);
  /* …caution, critical, agent, info, neutral identically… */
  /* series */
  --color-series-1: var(--series-1); /* …2,3,4 */
  /* radius */
  --radius-0: 0px;  --radius-2: 2px;  --radius-4: 4px;  --radius-6: 6px;
  --radius-8: 8px;  --radius-10: 10px; --radius-12: 12px; --radius-14: 14px;
  --radius-16: 16px; --radius-20: 20px;
  /* shadow */
  --shadow-elev-1: var(--elev-1);
  --shadow-elev-2: var(--elev-2);
  --shadow-elev-3: var(--elev-3);
  /* type */
  --font-sans: var(--font-open-sans), ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;
  --font-mono: var(--font-geist-mono), ui-monospace, monospace;
  /* spacing 1..12 mirror §6.1 */
}
```

Usage reads `bg-canvas`, `bg-raised`, `border-hairline`, `text-ink-3`, `shadow-elev-1`,
`rounded-12`, `text-positive-text`. **`--accent`, `--success` and `--warning` are deleted:
they are currently defined as synonyms for `--foreground` and `--muted-foreground`, which is
why nine `text-accent` call sites across the app render as plain body text.**

Typography roles ship as utility classes (`.t-body-strong`, `.t-label-caps`, `.t-metric-xl`,
`.t-mono-hash`, …) generated from the §3.4 table, each setting `font-size`, `font-weight`,
`line-height`, `letter-spacing` and — for numeric and mono roles —
`font-variant-numeric`. **Ad-hoc `text-[13px]` is a review failure.** The codebase currently
has seven undeclared sizes across 188 call sites; all of them resolve to a role.

### 9.1 Button

**Anatomy.** Pill (`--r-full`), optional 16px leading icon at 8px gap, label, optional 12px
trailing chevron for split/menu buttons.

| Size | Height | Padding | Label role | Icon |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `xs` | 28px | 0 10px | `caption-strong` | 14px |
| `sm` | 32px | 0 12px | `caption-strong` | 14px |
| `md` *(default)* | 36px | 0 16px | `body-strong` | 16px |
| `lg` | 44px | 0 20px | `body-strong` | 16px |

**Variants.**

- **primary** — fill `--action-fill`, label `--action-label`, no border. Hover
  `--action-fill-hover`; active `--action-fill-active`.
- **secondary** — `--surface-raised`, `1px solid var(--line-border)`, label
  `--text-primary`. Hover: fill `--state-hover`, border `--line-strong`. Active
  `--state-active`.
- **ghost** — transparent, label `--text-secondary`. Hover `--state-hover` + label
  `--text-primary`.
- **destructive-ghost** — label `--critical-text`. Hover `--critical-wash`.
- **destructive-solid** — fill `--critical-mark`, label `#FFFFFF` (light) / `#14161A`
  (dark). **Permitted on exactly one element in the product: the confirm button inside a
  destructive confirmation dialog.** Measured 5.53:1 / 5.38:1.

**States.**
- *focus-visible* — the two-stop monochrome ring (§5.8). On a primary fill the first stop
  is `--action-fill` and the second is `--action-label`, so the ring reads on the button
  itself.
- *disabled* — `opacity: 0.4`, `cursor: not-allowed`, all hover suppressed. When a tooltip
  must explain *why*, use `aria-disabled="true"` and keep the element focusable rather than
  the `disabled` attribute.
- *loading* — `min-width` locked to the measured pre-click width; the leading icon slot
  becomes a 14px 2px-stroke 270° arc, 700ms linear; the label persists;
  `aria-busy="true"`; `pointer-events: none`.
- *pressed / toggled* — `--state-selected` fill, label `--text-primary`, `aria-pressed`.

**Never:** a coloured primary; a gradient; `transition: all` (transition only
`background-color, border-color, color, box-shadow`); an icon-only button without an
`aria-label`; `active:scale-*` on a full-width submit.

---

### 9.2 Icon button

28px `--r-6` (dense: table row actions, card headers, top bar) or 32px `--r-8` (toolbars) or
40px `--r-full` (top-bar identity). Icon 16px, 1.5px stroke, `--text-tertiary`.

**States** — hover: `--state-hover` fill **and** icon → `--text-primary` (the current app's
ghost variant changes only the text colour, giving the three topbar controls no hit-area
feedback at all); active `--state-active`; focus-visible two-stop ring; toggled-on
`--state-selected` + icon `--text-primary` + filled icon variant; disabled 40% opacity.

Always carries an `aria-label` and, in dense rows, a 400ms-delay tooltip. **In a table row
the action cluster is `opacity: 0` until row hover or `focus-within`, then 90ms to 1 — but
the cluster always reserves its width, so the row never reflows.** On coarse pointers the
cluster is permanently visible.

---

### 9.3 Segmented control

**Anatomy.** A pill **track**: `--track` fill, `1px solid var(--line-hairline)`, 3px inner
padding, `display: inline-flex`, no gaps between segments. The active segment is a **thumb**:
`--surface-raised` (dark: `--surface-overlay`), `--r-full`, `--elev-1`, absolutely
positioned behind the labels.

| Size | Track | Thumb | Label | Segment min-w / padding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sm` | 28px | 22px | `micro` | 40px / 0 10px |
| `md` | 34px | 28px | `caption-strong` | 44px / 0 14px |

**States** — inactive label `--text-secondary`, hover → `--text-primary` with **no fill**;
active label `--text-primary`; the thumb animates `transform: translateX()` + `width`
`--dur-2 --ease-move` while labels stay still; focus-visible rings the **track**, arrows
move selection, Home/End jump; a disabled segment is `--text-quaternary` and the thumb does
not travel to it; a disabled control drops the track to `opacity: 0.5`.

**Maximum 5 segments** — beyond that use a Select. Uses: chart range (`7D · 30D · 90D · 1Y`),
diff mode (`Unified · Split`), density (`Comfortable · Compact`), document mode (`Read ·
Edit · History`), timeline scope (`All · Humans · Agents`).

**Zero-data:** the control stays enabled and interactive. A range with no data renders an
empty chart (§11), never a disabled control.

---

### 9.4 Filter chip

**Anatomy.** `--r-full`, height 30px, padding 0 12px (0 10px with a 14px leading element,
gap 6px), `--surface-raised`, `1px solid var(--line-border)`, label `caption-strong`
`--text-secondary`. **The count is part of the label, in parentheses, tabular, one tier
lighter:** `Open (2)` where `(2)` is `--text-tertiary`. Optional trailing 12px × when
removable.

**States** — hover: fill `--state-hover`, border `--line-strong`, label `--text-primary`.
**Selected: fill `--text-primary`, label and count `--text-inverse` (count at 70% opacity),
border transparent** — monochrome, a deliberate departure from the reference's tinted active
chip, because *selection is chrome, not status*. Selected hover: `--action-fill-hover`.
Focus-visible: two-stop ring. Disabled (zero matches available): `opacity: 0.4`, not
clickable. A chip whose count is `0` but which is still selectable stays enabled with its
label at `--text-tertiary`.

**Status-filter variant** gains a leading 6px status dot in the role's `-mark` — the only
colour a chip may carry. On a selected chip the dot switches to `--surface-raised` at 100%
so it stays visible on the inverted fill.

**Chip bar.** Horizontal, 8px gaps, `overflow-x: auto` with 24px `mask-image` edge fades and
no visible scrollbar. An `All (N)` scope chip is always first, **followed by a 1px ×
18px `--line-hairline` vertical rule with 12px on each side** (this separator is in the
Remote jobs reference and it is what turns a chip row into a control rather than a pile).
Selection is single or multi per instance and is announced with `role="group"` +
`aria-pressed` per chip.

**Empty:** the bar renders only a disabled `All (0)` chip. It is never omitted, because its
absence and a zero result look identical.

---

### 9.5 Icon tile

The leading element of list rows, quick-action cards, right-rail rows, banners and empty
states.

| Size | Radius | Icon |
|---|---|---|
| 28px | `--r-8` | 14px |
| 32px | `--r-10` | 16px |
| 40px | `--r-12` | 20px |
| 48px | `--r-14` | 24px |

**Default (neutral):** ground `--surface-inset`, icon `--text-secondary`, **no border, no
shadow**. This is a deliberate deviation from the references, which tint every tile: under
P1 a tile is tinted only when it *encodes state*.

**Status variant:** ground `--{role}-wash`, icon `--{role}-text`. Legal uses: a failed run,
an expiring key, a merged branch, an agent identity, a conflicted document.

**Agent identity tile:** 24px `--r-6` (or 28px `--r-8`), `--agent-wash` ground, 13px agent
glyph in `--agent-text` — **square where a human avatar is round** (§5.3).

**Department tile:** the department glyph on `--surface-inset`; in dense cells the glyph is
followed by the three-letter code in `mono-micro` (§8.3).

**Hover** (only when the tile sits inside an interactive row/card): the ground steps one
level toward the ink — light `#E8EAEE`, dark `#282C33` — at `--dur-1`. A tile is never
independently focusable or clickable.

---

### 9.6 Status dot and status pill

**Dot.** A filled circle in `--{role}-mark`: **8px** in table cells and list rows, **6px** as
a notification/unread indicator, **10px** in a page header. `flex-shrink: 0`, and it sits in
a fixed 14px leading slot in a table so labels align across rows whether or not a dot is
present. **Always followed by a text label at 6px gap — a dot alone is never sufficient**
(colour-blindness and zoom).

*Ring variant* (1.5px stroke, transparent centre) = the state is pending, scheduled or
inactive. *Live variant* (a running run, an actively-used key) adds a 1px ring at 2px offset
in `color-mix(in oklab, var(--{role}-mark) 40%, transparent)` and pulses `opacity 1 → 0.5`
over 1600ms `--ease-move` infinite alternate; under reduced motion it becomes a static ring.
*Absent* renders an em dash in `--text-tertiary`, **never a grey dot**.

**Pill.** Height 22px, `--r-full`, padding `0 8px 0 6px`, gap 6px, no border. Contents: a 6px
dot in `--{role}-mark` + text in `label-caps`. Ground `--{role}-wash`, text `--{role}-text`.
Neutral uses `--neutral-wash` + `--text-tertiary`. **Never interactive** — if it needs a
menu, put a 20px chevron icon-button beside it, not inside it. Max width 140px then truncate.

**The complete state map — no other pill strings exist:**

| Object | States |
|---|---|
| Document | `DRAFT` caution · `IN REVIEW` info · `ACTIVE` positive · `ARCHIVED` neutral |
| Branch | `OPEN` info · `MERGED` positive · `CONFLICT` critical · `ABANDONED` neutral |
| Diff entry | `ADDED` info · `CLEAN` positive · `CONFLICT` critical · `IDENTICAL` neutral *(visually retired)* |
| Agent key | `ACTIVE` positive · `EXPIRING` caution · `EXPIRED` neutral · `REVOKED` critical |
| Run | `RUNNING` agent + live dot · `SUCCEEDED` positive · `FAILED` critical · `QUEUED` neutral |
| Webhook delivery | `OK` positive · `FAILED` critical |
| Member | `OWNER` · `ADMIN` · `MEMBER` — all `neutral` wash; **tier is carried by grouping and the capability grid, not by hue** |

---

### 9.7 Stat strip — the signature component

**One container.** `--surface-raised`, `--r-12`, `--elev-1`, `overflow: hidden`,
`display: grid` with equal columns, min-height 104px. **Cells are NOT separate cards and
there are NO gaps:** every cell after the first takes
`border-left: 1px solid var(--line-hairline)`, **inset 16px top and bottom** so the rule does
not touch the container edge.

**Cell anatomy**, padding 16px 20px:
1. **Label row** — 14px icon `--text-tertiary` + `label-caps` `--text-tertiary`, 6px gap.
   (`COMMITS · 30D`, `DOCUMENTS AT HEAD`, `ACTIVE KEYS`, `TOKENS / ACCEPTED RECEIPT`.)
2. **Value** — `metric-xl` `--text-primary`, 12px above. A 72×28 sparkline is absolutely
   positioned bottom-right, 20px from the right edge, baseline-aligned to the value.
3. **Delta row** — 8px above: an 8px ▲/▼ glyph + `metric-sm` in `--positive-text` /
   `--critical-text` + `micro` `--text-tertiary` suffix (`vs prev 30d`).

**The delta component takes a `polarity` prop.** For `tokens_per_accepted_receipt` and every
cost metric, a **downward** arrow is `positive` green. Hardcoding ▲ = good renders the
product's headline economics discipline backwards.

**Abbreviation:** at ≥5 significant digits the value abbreviates (`12.4k`, `1.2M`) with the
exact figure in a hover tooltip. Open Sans tabular figures are noticeably wider than its
proportional ones, and a 4-up strip at 1200px overflows without this.

**States.**
- *hover* — only when the cell links to a filtered view: the full cell bleed takes
  `--state-hover` (90ms) and a 14px arrow glyph fades in top-right. The strip **never lifts**.
- *focus-visible* — the ring inset 2px so it does not clip against `overflow: hidden`.
- *loading* — value → a 112×30 skeleton, delta → 80×13, sparkline → 72×28. The label renders
  live.
- *empty (zero data)* — the value renders `—` in `--text-tertiary` at `metric-xl`; the
  sparkline is replaced by a 1px dashed `--line-hairline` across the full 72px at the
  vertical centre; the delta row reads `no prior period` in `micro` `--text-tertiary`.
  **The strip never collapses or hides when empty — a blank gauge is information.**
- *error* — value `—` plus a 12px `critical` glyph beside the label with an explanatory
  tooltip.

**Responsive:** 4-up ≥1200px · 2×2 ≥720px (the horizontal seam becomes
`border-top: 1px solid var(--line-hairline)`) · 1-up below, all inside the one container.
**The gaps never come back.**

---

### 9.8 Data table

**Container** — `--surface-raised`, `--r-14`, `--elev-1`, `overflow: hidden`.

**Header row** — 40px, `--surface-inset`, `position: sticky; top: var(--header-h)`,
`border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line-strong)`; gains `--elev-sticky` and flattens its top
corners once scrolled. **Every header cell carries a 14px type icon** `--text-tertiary` +
`label-caps` `--text-secondary` + a sort affordance: two stacked 6px chevrons, both at 35%
opacity when unsorted; when sorted, the active chevron goes 100% `--text-primary` and the
inactive one hides. Hover fills `--state-hover` and promotes the label to `--text-primary`.
Sortable headers are `<button>`s with `aria-sort`. Column resize handles are 8px hit areas
showing a 1px `--line-strong` line on drag. **Sorting is instant — no row animation.**

**Body row** — 56px two-line / 44px single-line (Compact: 40 / 36),
`border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line-hairline)`, none on the last.

- **Two-line cell** — line 1 `body-strong` `--text-primary`, truncating with an ellipsis plus
  a 400ms tooltip carrying the full string; line 2 `caption` `--text-tertiary` with ` · `
  separators (`Marketing · v14 · 6 fields`). 4px between lines (§6.2).
- **Numeric cell** — right-aligned, tabular, `metric-sm`. A delta column appends ▲/▼ +
  `metric-sm` in the polarity colour.
- **Identifier cell** — `mono-hash` `--text-secondary`, 7-char hash with a 20px copy
  icon-button revealed on cell hover; or `mono-seq` in the fixed 56px right-aligned column.
- **Status cell** — 8px dot + `body` label. The dot is the only colour in the row.
- **Threshold-typed numeric cell** — the band colour is applied to **the value text only,
  never to the row background and never to the cell fill.** A 40-row table of tinted rows is
  a heat map, not a ledger.
- The leading column may carry a 28px icon tile.

**Row states** — hover `--state-hover` (90ms) + the trailing action cluster fades in;
selected `--state-selected` + a 2px full-height `--text-primary` inset left bar;
focus-visible an inset two-stop ring on the row; expanded (revision rows) rotates a chevron
90° and opens a nested panel via `grid-template-rows: 0fr→1fr` on `--surface-inset` with a
4px `--text-primary` left bar; archived/disabled drops every text tier by one and shows a
lock glyph in the leading slot; **a row with uncommitted changes shows a 2px
`--caution-mark` inset left bar.**

**Zebra striping is permitted only on tables wider than 8 columns** (odd rows
`--surface-inset`). Everything else uses hairlines.

**Horizontal overflow** scrolls inside the card with the first column
`position: sticky; left: 0` and a 12px right-edge gradient shadow that appears only once
scrolled.

**Footer** — 48px, `border-top: 1px solid var(--line-border)`, `--surface-raised`, padding
0 16px, space-between. Left: `micro` `--text-tertiary` tabular record count
(`4 records` / `1–25 of 1,284`). Right, 12px gaps: a 28px `--r-full` rows-per-page pill
select (`Rows 25` + 12px chevron), then 28px circular prev/next icon buttons, then page
numbers as 28px circular ghost buttons where the current page is `--action-fill` /
`--action-label`. Prev/next disable at the ends. **The footer is hidden when the table shows
its empty state.**

**Table states** — *loading*: the header renders live with real column widths, the body
shows 8 skeleton rows at exact geometry (two bars per two-line cell at 60% and 38% width,
widths chosen deterministically from the row index so the pattern does not flicker between
renders). *empty*: a full-span 240px cell holding the EmptyState block, **header row
retained** so column meaning survives. *filtered-to-zero*: same cell, but the copy names the
active filters and the primary action is `Clear filters`. *error*: full-span cell,
`--critical-text` message + `Retry`.

### 9.9 Underline tabs

A 44px row sitting on a full-width `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line-border)`. Triggers:
`display: flex`, 24px gaps, padding 0 2px, label `body-strong` — inactive weight 500
`--text-tertiary`, active weight 650 `--text-primary`. A count suffix renders at 6px gap in
`micro` tabular `--text-quaternary` (`Revisions 128`); **`0` renders as `0`, never hidden**.

The active indicator is **one** absolutely-positioned 2px bar in `--text-primary` sitting on
the hairline, `--r-2` on its top corners, animating `transform: translateX()` + `width`
`--dur-2 --ease-move`. Never per-tab borders, never coloured.

**States** — hover promotes the inactive label to `--text-secondary` and shows a 2px
`--line-strong` bar at 50% opacity; focus-visible draws an inset ring around the label box
(the indicator does not move); disabled `--text-quaternary` with a tooltip explaining why.
Overflow scrolls horizontally with 24px mask fades and never wraps to two lines; the active
tab scrolls into view on mount. Panels crossfade over `--dur-3`, no translation.

Tabs express depth **within a record** (Read / Revisions / Media / Feedback on a document;
Overview / Scopes / Deliveries on a key). They are never top-level navigation, and never
used where a segmented control would do.

---

### 9.10 Navigation rail (sidebar)

`--surface-rail`, 264px (collapsed 64px), full height,
`border-right: 1px solid var(--line-border)`, `--elev-0`, **never a shadow**, its own scroll
container.

- **Brand block** — 52px, wordmark `title-4`, plus a 28px collapse icon-button at the right
  edge. **Not scrollable.**
- **Identity block — pinned, not scrolled.** The CompanySwitcher and BranchPicker sit
  *above* the scroll container. In a versioned multi-tenant product the two pieces of state
  you must never lose are which company and which branch you are writing to; today they live
  inside `overflow-y-auto` and scroll away the moment you open a 23-template department.
- **Search field** — 34px, `--r-full`, `--surface-inset`, `1px solid var(--line-hairline)`,
  14px magnifier `--text-tertiary`, placeholder `body` `--text-quaternary`, trailing `⌘K`
  kbd.
- **Section label** — `label-caps` `--text-tertiary`, padding `20px 12px 6px`,
  non-interactive, with `aria-labelledby` binding it to its group.
- **Nav row** — 34px, `--r-8`, padding 0 10px, gap 10px, 16px icon `--text-tertiary` +
  `body` (500) `--text-secondary`, optional right-aligned count in `mono-seq`
  `--text-tertiary`, optional 14px disclosure chevron.
- **Child rail** — a 1px `--line-hairline` vertical line at x=25px; children indented to
  34px, row height 30px, label `caption`.
- **Pinned utility block** — `margin-top: auto`, `border-top: 1px solid var(--line-border)`,
  12px padding: Settings · MCP endpoint · Help, then a 44px account row (24px avatar, name
  `caption` over role `micro` `--text-tertiary`, 14px chevron opening an `--elev-2` menu).

**States** — hover `--state-hover`, icon and label step up one tier. **Active:
`--surface-inset` fill, label `body-strong` `--text-primary`, icon `--text-primary` and its
filled variant, plus a 2px × 16px `--text-primary` bar at x=0, `--r-full`.** Monochrome, no
tint. The current `bg-foreground/[0.06]` wash alone is roughly 2% of contrast carrying the
user's location in an 11 × 23 space; **the bar is doing the work and may not be dropped for
tidiness.** Focus-visible: an inset two-stop ring. Disabled: 40% opacity.

**Collapsed (64px):** icons only, centred, labels move to 400ms-delay tooltips on the right;
section labels become a 16px-wide `--line-hairline` rule; **the active bar stays.**

**Accessibility:** each `<nav>` carries an `aria-label`; disclosure buttons carry
`aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. There is exactly one `<nav>` in the accessibility tree
at a time (the mobile Sheet's nav replaces the desktop one, it does not duplicate it).

**Loading:** 6 skeleton rows in a `<Suspense>` fallback. A bare `<Suspense>` with no
fallback — the current implementation — is a review failure.

---

### 9.11 Top bar

52px, `--surface-rail`, `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line-border)`, sticky, `z-index: 10`.

- **Left** — the breadcrumb: `micro` `--text-tertiary` segments, `/` separators in
  `--text-quaternary` with 6px margins, final segment `--text-secondary` at 500 and not a
  link. On a document surface the trail is `Company / Department / Document`, and a
  revision-scoped view appends a `mono-seq` segment (`#0142`) that links to the revision.
  Above 4 levels the middle collapses to a 20px `…` icon-button opening an `--elev-2` menu.
  **The left half of this bar is currently an empty `<div className="hidden lg:block" />` on
  every route in the product; that is the largest piece of dead space in the app and it is
  deleted.**
- **Centre** — empty at rest; carries `title-compact` once the large title has collapsed
  (§7.3), and the bar takes `--elev-sticky`.
- **Right** — a cluster of 28px `--r-6` ghost icon-buttons at 4px gaps (search, notifications),
  a 4px gap, a 1px × 20px `--line-hairline` vertical rule, 4px, then the 28px identity
  avatar opening the account menu.
- **Branch state** — when the session is on a non-main branch, a 28px BranchChip sits between
  the breadcrumb and the centre slot, **and the top bar takes a 2px `--caution-mark` bottom
  border in place of its hairline.** The branch is the most consequential mode in the
  product and it must be legible peripherally, without being looked at.

The theme control is **not** a top-level icon here. It moves into the account menu as a
three-way `Light · Dark · System` segmented control — the current two-state toggle silently
destroys the `system` default it cannot restore.

---

### 9.12 Page header

Sits on `--surface-canvas`, padding `24px 24px 20px`. **Owned by the shell as `<PageHeader>`;
no route hand-rolls it.** The identical `text-2xl font-medium tracking-tight` +
`mt-1 max-w-2xl text-[13px]` block is currently copy-pasted verbatim into ten of eleven app
pages, which is why arriving anywhere feels like arriving nowhere.

- **Row 1** — `display` (ATLAS, LEDGER STREAM, REGISTRY, BLANK SLATE only) or `title-2`
  everywhere else; optional inline status pill at 12px gap; optional `mono-hash` slug at
  12px gap in `--text-tertiary`. Right cluster, top-aligned: at most one primary button, at
  most two secondary, then a 28px overflow icon-button.
- **Row 2** *(optional)* — `caption` `--text-tertiary`, max 90ch.
- **Zero-data variant** — the description is replaced by a `micro` `--text-tertiary` fact
  (`No revisions yet`), the primary button remains and becomes the page's only affordance.

**Every archetype must vary at least one of: title role, action cluster, or the strip
immediately beneath.** A page header that is identical to its neighbour's is the defect this
component exists to prevent.

---

### 9.13 Card / panel

`--surface-raised`, `--r-12` (dense/table contexts `--r-14`; page-level and quick-action
`--r-16`), `--elev-1`, padding 20px (16px compact, 24px hero).

- **Header** *(optional)* — 52px, padding 0 16px: `title-3` left, action slot right
  (segmented control, ghost link, or a 28px overflow button).
  `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line-hairline)` **only when the body is a table, a list or
  a chart**; a prose body gets no rule, only 16px of space.
- **Body** — 16px padding; 0 for tables and lists, which bleed to the card edge.
- **Footer** *(optional)* — 48px, `border-top: 1px solid var(--line-hairline)`,
  `--surface-inset` for action footers.
- **Sections inside a card** are separated by 1px `--line-hairline` rules. **Never by a
  nested card** (§5.7).

**Interactive card** (department card, template card, quick action, media tile): the whole
card is one `<a>`/`<button>`; hover `--elev-1 → --elev-1-hover` + border `--line-strong` at
`--dur-2`, **no translate**; active `--state-active` overlay; focus-visible two-stop ring;
`h-full` on the wrapper so a wrapping title never leaves a row ragged.

`CardTitle` renders a configurable heading level (`as` prop), defaulting to `h3` **only when
nested under an `h2`**. Hardcoding `<h3>` breaks the document outline of every page by
construction, which the current primitive does.

---

### 9.14 `--surface-object` row and inset grouped list

Two closely-related primitives; both are flat and neither is ever shadowed.

**Object row** *(the Remote right-rail box)* — `--surface-object`, `--r-12`,
`1px solid var(--line-hairline)`, 12px 14px padding, 8px gaps in a stack. Contents: a 40px
icon tile (status-tinted only when the row carries a status) + a text block of `caption`
`--text-tertiary` caption over `metric-lg` tabular `--text-primary` value + an optional
parenthetical in `caption` `--text-tertiary` + an optional 12px trailing chevron when the row
navigates.

**Inset grouped list** *(the Apple idiom)* — inside an `--elev-1` card, rows separated by
`--line-hairline` rules that are **INSET TO THE TEXT ORIGIN** (`left inset = padding + tile
width + gap`), **never full-bleed**. This single detail is what makes a grouped list read as
one object rather than a stack of rows. Row 56px with a tile, 44px for a label/value pair;
leading 32px tile, `body-strong` primary over `caption` secondary, right-aligned value in
`body` `--text-secondary` (or `metric-sm` tabular when numeric), trailing 16px chevron when
navigable. The group's `label-caps` header sits **on the canvas above the card**, 12px below.

**States** — hover (navigable rows only) `--state-hover`; pressed `--state-active`;
focus-visible inset ring; disabled 45% opacity; an empty group renders a single 56px row of
`caption` `--text-tertiary` with no chevron.

---

### 9.15 Right-rail summary card

320px (360px ≥1600px), `position: sticky; top: calc(var(--header-h) + 16px)`, `--r-16`,
`--elev-1`, padding 20px.

- **Header** — `title-3` left; optional `caption-strong` ghost action right (monochrome,
  underline on hover).
- **Body — two variants, and the choice is a rule, not taste:**
  - **Inset** (§9.14 object rows, 8px gaps) when the rail is a **set of destinations or
    measured quantities** — run economics, branch divergence, key lifecycle.
  - **Ruled** (44px rows separated by `--line-hairline`, `label-caps` left, value
    `metric-sm`/`mono-hash` right) when the rail is a **list of facts** — document head
    metadata: seq, hash, author, kind, template version, updated, fork point.
- **Trailing blocks**, in order: a meter with its label pair; a 120×36 sparkline row; a
  full-width 36px secondary button.

**States** — *loading*: each value becomes a 64×13 skeleton. *empty*: every value renders `—`
in `--text-tertiary`, the meter renders its zero stub, and **the footer button promotes from
secondary to primary because it is now the only action on the surface.** *error*: a
`critical` Banner strip inside the card.

**Responsive:** below 1280px the rail unsticks and moves **above** the main column as a
full-width card whose rows become a 2- or 3-column grid divided by vertical
`--line-hairline` rules — it becomes a mini stat strip. It is never the only place a value
appears.

---

### 9.16 Quick-action card

The primary "next action" affordance. A square-ish `--elev-1` card, `--r-16`, min
168 × 132px, padding 20px, arranged in a 2- or 3-column grid at 16px gaps. Contents: a 40px
icon tile top-left → flex spacer → `body-strong` `--text-primary` label bottom-left →
optional `caption` `--text-tertiary` second line. **The whole card is one button.**

**States** — hover `--elev-1 → --elev-1-hover` **plus** the tile ground steps one level
toward the ink, `--dur-2`; active `--state-active`; focus-visible two-stop ring; disabled 45%
opacity with a `caption` reason replacing the second line; loading renders a 90×14 skeleton
label and is inert.

Product uses: *New document · New branch · Issue agent key · Import context · Run the
founding interview · Export company.*

---

### 9.17 Task / list row card

A standalone `--elev-1` card per row (`--r-16`, padding 16px 20px, min-height 76px, 12px
between rows) **or** a row inside a card. Left to right: 40px icon tile · a text block of
`body-strong` over `caption` `--text-tertiary` clamped to 2 lines · flex spacer · a right
cluster of a `caption` timestamp and/or a 28px button and/or a status pill.

**States** — hover `--elev-1-hover` when navigable; the right cluster sits at `opacity: 0.6`
at rest and 1 on hover/`focus-within`, **with its width always reserved**; focus-visible
ring; *completed* turns the tile `positive`-tinted with a check, the title
`--text-tertiary` with a 1px `--line-strong` strikethrough, and the card drops to
`--elev-0`; *dismissing* exits with opacity + `translateY(-4px)` over 120ms and the stack
reflows over `--dur-3`; *loading* 3 skeleton rows; *empty* the whole stack is replaced by
the EmptyState.

---

### 9.18 Sparkline

Hand-authored inline SVG. Default 72×28 (stat cell), 56×20 (table cell), 120×36 (right rail).

**Mechanics — mandatory.** `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` on the path; width from a
`ResizeObserver`, never `preserveAspectRatio="none"` (which distorts stroke weight
asymmetrically); `overflow: visible`; the path inset 2px vertically so peaks are not clipped.

- **Line variant** — monotone-cubic path, `stroke-width: 1.5`, `stroke-linecap: round`,
  colour `--series-1` (**graphite — a sparkline is single-series by definition and therefore
  always monochrome**), no axes, no gridlines, no dots, except a 2.5px filled terminal dot
  with a 1.5px `--surface-raised` halo.
- **Area variant** — adds a `<linearGradient>` from `--series-1` at 14% (20% dark) to 0%.
- **Bar variant** — the ForgeUI mark: 7–14 columns, 3px wide, 2px gap, `--r-2`, **all at
  `opacity: 0.30` except the final column at `opacity: 1`**, so the eye lands on "now"
  instantly. This is the most identifiable mark in the reference set and it is the default
  inside a stat-strip cell.
- **Threshold variant** — the terminal dot (line) or final column (bar) recolours to the band
  ink of the **latest** value only; the historical path never changes colour mid-line.

**States** — *hover* (only when the parent row is interactive): the line thickens to 2px at
`--dur-1`. *loading*: a skeleton block at exact geometry. *empty (<2 points)*: **a 1px
dashed `--line-hairline` across the full width at the vertical centre — never a flat line at
the baseline, which would falsely read as measured zero.** *single point*: the terminal dot
alone, horizontally centred.

A sparkline is a **glyph, not a chart**: it has no tooltip, no axis and no legend, and it is
permitted only in stat-strip cells, right-rail rows and the branch comparison matrix —
**never inside a standard data-table cell**, where the trend belongs in a delta numeral.

---

### 9.19 Chart primitives — governance

> **Exactly three chart primitives exist: `<Sparkline>`, `<AreaLineChart>`, `<BarChart>`,
> all built over ONE shared `scales/axis/ticks` utility module. One-off inline SVG is
> forbidden anywhere else in the codebase. A fourth chart type is added to the primitives,
> never to a page.**

Without this rule, hand-authored SVG across sixteen archetypes drifts into sixteen
inconsistent charts, which is worse than taking a dependency.

**The shared module owns:** nice-number tick generation; monotone-cubic interpolation
(**Catmull-Rom converted to cubic Béziers** — approximately twelve lines, which is what makes
the no-chart-library constraint a verified fact rather than an aspiration); the
`ResizeObserver` sizing path; the crosshair snap; axis-label thinning; **null-gap handling**;
and the empty/loading/error frames.

**Null gaps are the normal case, not an edge case.** A commits-per-day series for a young
company is mostly holes. **The path breaks at nulls rather than interpolating across them,
and the gap renders a 1px dashed `--line-hairline` connector.** A path that interpolates
across a gap overstates activity, which in this product is a lie about the ledger.

**Axis-label thinning is deterministic:** drop every other label, then every third, until no
two labels are within 64px. First and last are always shown and are edge-anchored rather than
centred.

---

### 9.20 Area / line chart

Inside an `--elev-1` card. Header 52px: `title-3` left, a segmented range control right.
Plot min-height 260px (compact 180, hero 320). Insets: left 44px (axis gutter), bottom 28px,
right 8px, top 12px.

- **Grid** — horizontal only, 4–5 lines, `1px dashed var(--line-hairline)` with
  `stroke-dasharray: 2 4`, drawn behind the series. **No vertical gridlines. No axis lines.**
- **Axis labels** — `micro` tabular `--text-tertiary`; y right-aligned in the gutter with an
  8px gap; x thinned per §9.19.
- **Series** — `stroke-width: 2`, `stroke-linejoin: round`, monotone-cubic; area fill a
  vertical gradient from 14% (20% dark) to 0% at 88% of plot height. **Max 4 series, assigned
  `--series-1` → `--series-4` in legend order.** One series is therefore fully monochrome.
- **Legend** — below the plot, 20px gaps: a 12×3 `--r-2` swatch + `caption`
  `--text-secondary`. Clicking toggles: the swatch drops to `--line-strong`, the label to
  `--text-quaternary`, and the path fades to `opacity: 0` over `--dur-2`.
- **Crosshair** — on pointer move a 1px dashed `--line-strong` vertical rule snaps to the
  nearest x-datum; each series shows a 3.5px filled dot with a 1.5px `--surface-raised` ring;
  an `--elev-2` hover card (`--surface-overlay`, `--r-12`, padding 8px 10px) shows a
  `label-caps` x header, a `--line-hairline` rule, then one row per series: swatch +
  `caption` name + right-aligned `metric-sm` tabular value. **The card flips side at the
  plot's midpoint.**

**States** — *loading*: the frame, gridlines and axis labels render **immediately**; the plot
area holds a skeleton block. *empty*: **gridlines and axes still render** (an empty gauge is
a gauge), with a centred `caption` `--text-tertiary` line (`No commits in this range`) and a
ghost `Widen to 1Y` button. *error*: the same frame, a `--critical-text` message and `Retry`.

---

### 9.21 Bar / column chart

Same card chrome. Columns `--r-2` on the **top two corners only**, computed width
`(W − (n−1)·gap)/n`, gap 2px at ≤40 bars and 1px above, **minimum rendered height 2px so a
non-zero value is never invisible**, baseline a 1px `--line-hairline` rule.

**The default fill is `--line-strong`, not a series colour**, because a commit-frequency
chart is not a series — it is one quantity over time. **The most recent column fills
`--text-primary` to anchor "now."** A series colour is used only when the bars are one member
of a genuine multi-series comparison.

**Hover:** the hovered column goes to `--text-primary` (or 100% of its series colour) and all
others drop to `opacity: 0.4` at `--dur-1`; the `--elev-2` hover card appears above it.
Value labels print above columns only when column width ≥24px, in `micro` tabular
`--text-tertiary`. Zero-value columns render a 2px `--line-hairline` stub at the baseline so
the slot is still legible.

*Empty*: baseline rule only + a centred `caption` `No commits in this range`.

---

### 9.22 Meter

Linear, never a donut or a radial. Track `--track`, `--r-full`; fill `--r-full`.
Heights: `sm` 4px · `md` 6px · `lg` 8px.

**Fill colour is a rule, not a choice:**
- **Monochrome `--text-primary`** when the meter shows neutral progress — document
  completeness, registry coverage, upload progress. *Progress is a quantity, not a status.*
- **A band `-mark`** only when the meter encodes a **threshold** — key lifetime remaining,
  quota consumed, freshness against cadence. Bands carry 1px `--surface-raised` notches at
  each boundary so they read at a glance.

**Label row** above, 8px gap: `label-caps` `--text-tertiary` left, `metric-md` tabular value
right (in the band ink when threshold-typed). Optional `caption` below at 6px.

**Segmented variant** (agent-key lane coverage, registry three-state coverage): N equal
segments at 4px gaps, each `--text-primary` when filled and `--track` when not; each segment
is labelled by department code in a tooltip and by an `aria-label` on the group.

**States** — *mount*: `width 0 → value`, `--dur-3 --ease-out`, once. *value change*: width
only; the number never animates. *indeterminate*: a 30%-wide `--text-primary` fill sweeping
`-30% → 130%` over 1100ms. *zero*: **an empty track with a 2px `--line-hairline` stub at the
left end and `0` in `--text-tertiary` — visibly present-and-zero, never a 1px sliver and
never absent.** *no denominator*: the track renders at `--line-hairline` with a centred `—`
and no fill. *over-100%*: the fill clamps and a 2px `--critical-mark` cap appears at the
right end. *complete*: the label value takes `--positive-text` when completion is the goal.

---

### 9.23 Revision rail and commit node — the signature structure

**The rail is a real grid track, not a decoration.** The page sets
`grid-template-columns: var(--rail-gutter) 1fr`, nodes are drawn per row, and **the spine is
a per-row 1px pseudo-element, never one tall absolutely-positioned line.** A single
full-height line cannot survive windowed rendering of a 10,000-commit timeline; the current
codebase draws exactly that (`absolute left-[11px] top-7 h-full w-px bg-border`, byte-identical
in `timeline/page.tsx` and `runs/page.tsx`) and it is the construction being replaced.

- **Spine** — 1px `--line-hairline` at x = 13.5px within the 28px gutter. It terminates flush
  with the head node's top and ends in a 3px rounded cap 8px below the last node.
- **Node vertical centre** aligns to 14px from the row top — the optical centre of the row's
  first text line — not the row's geometric centre.
- **Branch lanes** at x = 14 + 20n, **capped at 4 lanes**, then collapsed to an 18px `+n`
  pill. Fork/merge curves are 1px `--line-strong` quarter-arcs of radius 8 over a 16px
  vertical run, `stroke-linecap: round`.

**Commit node variants:**

| Variant | Form |
|---|---|
| Normal (human) | 9px **circle**, fill `--surface-canvas`, 1.5px ring `--text-tertiary` |
| Normal (agent) | 9px **rounded square** `--r-2`, same fill and ring — shape carries authorship |
| **Head** | 10px, fill `--positive-mark`, a 3px gap ring in the parent surface colour, **plus** a 1px `--positive-mark` outer ring at 16px — a reticle. Head is the only node with two rings. |
| Branch | ring `--agent-mark` |
| Merge | 11px with a 1px horizontal bar through it at node width +4px |
| Conflicted | ring `--critical-mark` + a 1px vertical bar through the centre |
| Selected | fill `--text-primary`, no ring, a 4px `--surface-inset` halo |

**Commit row.** 60px, `border-radius: 0 var(--r-8) var(--r-8) 0` (the rail exception),
padding `12px 16px 12px 12px`, flush against the rail with no gap.
Line 1: the commit **message** in `body-strong` truncated to one line, with the sequence
number `#0142` in `mono-seq` right-aligned in the fixed 56px column. Line 2 (4px gap): a 16px
author element (round avatar / square agent tile) + author name in `caption`
`--text-secondary` + `·` + relative time in `caption` `--text-tertiary` + the HashChip + a
DepartmentChip. A commit touching >1 document appends a `4 docs` count chip.

**Rows are separated by a `--line-hairline` inset 12px from the left**, so it starts after the
rail and the spine reads as continuous.

**States** — hover `--state-hover` across the full bleed, node ring rises to
`--text-secondary`, and a 14px `→` glyph appears at the right; selected `--state-selected` +
a 2px `--text-primary` bar drawn over the spine; focus-visible a two-stop ring at the rail
radius; a commit on an unreachable branch drops every text tier and its node ring to
`--text-quaternary`.

**Empty:** **the spine is not drawn at all — a rail with no commits is a lie about history.**
Render the EmptyState instead.

**Critically, this component renders `event.doc`, `event.rev` and `event.branch`.** Those
three objects are already returned by `api.timeline.list` and are currently thrown away, so
today's feed shows less than `git log --oneline` in a product whose pitch is version control.

### 9.24 Hash chip, sequence ref, department chip, branch chip

**HashChip** — inline-flex, 20px tall, `--r-4`, padding 0 6px, `--surface-inset`,
`1px solid var(--line-hairline)`, `mono-hash` `--text-secondary`. **Exactly 7 characters.**
A 14px copy slot is *reserved* at 6px gap and its glyph fades in on hover at `--dur-1`, so
nothing shifts. On click the label swaps to `copied` in the same mono at the same width for
1200ms — **no colour change, because a successful copy is not a status.** Long variant
(revision detail): 28px, `--r-6`, `mono-hash-lg`, the full 40 characters, with a trailing kbd
for the copy shortcut. Absent renders `—` in `--text-tertiary`, **never an empty chip**.

**SequenceRef** — `mono-seq` `--text-tertiary`, `#` + four-digit zero-padded number, in a
fixed 56px right-aligned column. On a detail surface it promotes to a `label-caps` kicker
(`REVISION`) above `metric-lg` `--text-primary`. Never truncates (§3.5).

**DepartmentChip** — 22px, `--r-full`, `--surface-inset`, `1px solid var(--line-hairline)`:
the 14px department glyph + the label. In dense cells the label is the three-letter code in
`mono-micro`; elsewhere it is the full `ViewMeta.label`. **Never the raw lowercase ViewId** —
the current pull cards print `from brand` because the one label lookup the page needs it does
not do.

**BranchChip** — 24px, `--r-full`, `--surface-inset`, `1px solid var(--line-hairline)`, a
12px branch glyph + the branch **name** in `caption-strong` truncated at 160px, plus an
ahead/behind suffix `↑3 ↓1` in `mono-seq` `--text-tertiary`. The glyph takes `--agent-mark`
on branch-scoped surfaces; **`main` always renders its glyph in `--text-secondary` and is
never violet.** A conflicted branch prepends an 8px `--critical-mark` dot. States: hover
`--state-hover` + border `--line-border`; active (currently-viewed) `--action-fill` with
`--action-label` text; focus-visible ring; a merged or abandoned branch reached by URL renders
its status pill inline so a frozen branch can never masquerade as an open one.

---

### 9.25 Authorship stamp / avatar

**Human avatar** — `--r-full`, sizes 16 / 20 / 24 / 28 / 40. Image, or initials in `micro`
(600) `--text-secondary` on `--surface-inset` with a 1px `rgba(20,22,26,0.06)` inset ring so
light images keep an edge. **Neutral grey — never a generated hue.**

**Agent glyph** — the same sizes but `--r-6` / `--r-8` (a squircle), `--agent-wash` ground, a
14px agent icon or a two-character mono code in `--agent-text`. An agent stamp **additionally
renders the issuing key's short id as a HashChip**, so every machine write is traceable to a
key.

**Stamp** — avatar + name in `caption` `--text-secondary` + `·` + a `<RelativeTime>`.
**Stacked variant**: up to 3 avatars overlapping by 8px with a 2px `--surface-raised` ring
each, then a `+N` count chip in `micro`.

The topbar's account chip renders the signed-in user's real initials. The literal hardcoded
string `me` currently shipped there is a defect.

---

### 9.26 `<RelativeTime>`

Renders `<time dateTime={iso}>` containing `timeAgo(ts)`, with the absolute
`formatDate(ts)` in both `title` and an on-focus tooltip. **The absolute value is never
hover-only**, because the exact timestamp is what correlates a run with a commit and hover is
unavailable on touch.

**Future timestamps** (agent-key expiry) use a **separate** `<Countdown>` component with an
urgency ramp — `> 30d` `--text-tertiary` · `7–30d` `--text-secondary` · `< 7d`
`--caution-text` + a caution dot · `< 24h` `--critical-text` — and always print the absolute
date beside the relative one. `timeAgo()` is written for the past; passing a future timestamp
through it, as `/agents` does today, is a bug.

---

### 9.27 Input, textarea, select, and the field primitive

**Input** — 36px (compact 32, touch 44), `--r-6`, `--surface-raised`,
`1px solid var(--line-border)`, padding 0 12px, `body` `--text-primary`, placeholder
`--text-quaternary`. Hover: border `--line-strong`. Focus: border `--text-primary` + the
two-stop ring. Error: border `--critical-border`, a 14px `--critical-mark` glyph inside the
right edge, and the helper text swaps to `--critical-text`, wired with `aria-invalid` and
`aria-describedby` — **the input's own text never turns red.** Async-validated success: a
14px `--positive-mark` check inside the right edge, border unchanged — **no green border.**
Disabled: `--surface-inset` ground, `--text-quaternary` value. Read-only: no border,
`--surface-inset` ground, `cursor: text`. Loading: a 14px spinner in the right edge.

**Textarea** — the same, `min-height: 96px`, `resize: vertical`, `line-height: 22px`.

**Select** — the same box + a 14px chevron `--text-tertiary` at 12px inset, opening an
`--elev-2` `--r-8` menu with 32px `--r-6` rows and a 14px check on the selected row. **This
replaces every raw `<select>` in the app** — there are currently three, at two different
sizes, on two pages, in a codebase that already ships a styled DropdownMenu.

**Field** — the wrapper, and the only sanctioned way to render a labelled control:
`label-caps` `--text-tertiary` label (bound with `htmlFor`/`id` via a real `<label>`), 6px,
the control, 6px, `caption` `--text-tertiary` helper or `--critical-text` error. A
`label-caps` `REQUIRED` badge on `--caution-wash` or `OPTIONAL` on `--neutral-wash` sits
inline right of the label. **A character counter is mandatory wherever the server enforces a
cap** — commit message 500, title 200, interview answer 4000, import source 200 000, webhook
description 200 — rendered in `micro` `--text-tertiary`, turning `--caution-text` at 90% and
`--critical-text` at 100%.

**Checkbox** 18px `--r-4`, 1.5px `--line-strong` border; checked = `--action-fill` with a 12px
`--action-label` check drawn over 160ms. **Radio** identical but `--r-full` with an 8px inner
dot. **Switch** 44×26 track `--r-full`, off `--track` + `1px --line-strong`, on
`--action-fill`; 20px knob travelling 18px at `--dur-2 --ease-move`. **None of these is ever
coloured.** All carry a 44px hit area on coarse pointers and a clickable adjacent `body`
label.

---

### 9.28 Field editor family (the document body)

Three genuinely distinct editors sharing one field chrome. They are not one component with a
`compact` boolean; the current implementation distinguishes a quadrant of a strategy canvas
from a section of a 14-field record by `text-[12px]` vs `text-[13px]`, which is not a design.

- **Field chrome** — the `label-caps` name; **the registry `hint` rendered persistently as
  `caption` `--text-tertiary` beneath the label in BOTH read and edit mode** (today it is a
  placeholder that vanishes the moment you type, and is absent from read mode entirely — the
  guidance disappears exactly when the field is empty and confusing); and a 24px right-gutter
  **status slot** outside the text measure showing: nothing when clean · a 6px
  `--caution-mark` dot when locally modified · a 6px `--critical-mark` dot when
  required-and-empty · a 14px lock when read-only on this branch · a 10px spinner while
  saving.
- **Prose field** — read mode is a `body-read` block capped at 68ch; edit mode is a borderless
  textarea showing a 1px `--line-hairline` bottom rule on hover and the full input treatment
  on focus. At rest the editor reads as a document, not a form.
- **List field** — **a real item-per-row editor**: 32px rows, a 6px `--line-strong` bullet, a
  16px drag handle fading in at the row's left on hover, a delete icon-button at the right,
  keyboard reorder (space to grab, ↑↓ to move), and an `+ Add item` ghost row at the end.
  Read mode is the same row rhythm without controls. **Not a textarea split on `\n`** — the
  registry's most common field type (257 fields) currently has the least designed editor,
  where an empty line becomes an empty item and reordering means retyping.
- **Table field / DataGrid** — a real grid: **column typing inferred from `column.label`**
  (status / owner / hex / date / currency / numeric / URL / RICE) driving alignment,
  tabular-nums and right-alignment for numerics, and derived column widths; a sticky header
  in `label-caps` on `--surface-inset`; row numbers; keyboard cell traversal (arrow / tab /
  enter); paste-from-TSV; row handles with reorder; per-row delete **with undo**; and a
  horizontal-scroll shadow. 120 table fields up to 8 columns depend on this. Colour swatches
  render in **both** read and edit mode.
- **Canvas frame + cell** — for the 15 layout kinds: a CSS grid from the template's
  `layout.areas` / `layout.columns` with **shared hairline walls and equal-height rows**, not
  floating boxes. Cells are `--surface-inset`, `--r-10`, a `label-caps` area name pinned
  top-left, an `--text-tertiary` item count top-right, `min-height: 120px`, and **in-cell
  overflow scrolling so one long block cannot collapse the canonical silhouette.** Empty
  cells are `1px dashed var(--line-hairline)` with a one-line prompt. Read-only cells take a
  3px diagonal `--line-hairline` hatch at 8%.
- **Empty field states are typed, not one sentence.** An empty table renders **its column
  headers**; an empty list renders one ghost row plus its expected cardinality; an empty
  prose field renders its hint. The single italic `Not filled in yet.` currently used for all
  three is deleted.

---

### 9.29 Commit bar

The component that makes the versioning model unavoidable. Sticky to the bottom of the
**content column** (aligned to its gutters, not the viewport edge), 64px, `--surface-rail`,
`border-top: 1px solid var(--line-border)`, `--elev-sticky-up`, `--r-12` on its top corners,
padding 0 24px, `z-index: 20`.

- **Left** — the DiffSummary (`+18 −4`) + `micro` `3 fields changed in 1 document`, with a 6px
  `--caution-mark` dot when dirty and no dot when clean.
- **Centre** (`flex: 1`, max 560px) — the commit-message input, 36px, `--r-6`,
  `--surface-inset`, placeholder `Describe this revision`.
- **Right** — a ghost `Discard` (destructive-ghost on hover) and a primary `Commit`, 8px gap.

**The message field is pre-filled with a generated-from-diff default that the user edits.**
An empty required field produces `update` and `.` within a week, and the timeline's entire
legibility argument collapses when every row's line 1 is one character.

**States** — *clean*: the bar drops to `opacity: 0.6`, the input disables, Commit disables,
the counter reads `No changes`. *dirty + empty message*: Commit is `aria-disabled` with a
400ms tooltip `A commit message is required`; **the input does not turn red until submit is
attempted.** *submitting*: Commit enters its loading state, the input and Discard disable,
**the bar keeps its exact height.** *success*: the bar returns to clean and a toast carries
the new `mono-hash` with a `View revision` action, while the rail's new head node fires its
single pulse. *conflict*: the bar grows to 88px to hold a `--critical-wash` strip naming the
conflicting document count and a `Review conflicts` secondary button.

Both whole-document overwrites — `Discard` and `Draft with AI` — route through
`<ConfirmDialog>`. They currently fire silently at the visual weight of tertiary links.

---

### 9.30 Diff viewer

Container `--elev-1`, `--r-14`, `overflow: hidden`.

- **Header** — 52px, `--surface-inset`, bottom `--line-strong`: two revision selectors
  (`mono-hash` chips with chevrons) either side of a 14px arrow glyph on the left; a
  `Unified · Split` segmented control and a `Whitespace` toggle on the right.
- **Gutter** — 56px (28px per side in split), `--surface-inset`, `mono-micro`
  `--text-quaternary` line numbers right-aligned with 8px padding, `user-select: none`,
  `border-right: 1px solid var(--line-hairline)`.
- **Marker column** — 14px, holding `+`, `−` or a space in `mono-code` at the diff ink.
- **Content** — `mono-code` `--text-primary`, `white-space: pre`, `tab-size: 2`,
  horizontally scrollable with the gutter sticky.
- **Row backgrounds** — `--diff-add-bg` / `--diff-del-bg` / `--diff-move-bg` with a 3px left
  gutter bar in the matching `-gutter` token; context is transparent, never tinted.
  Intra-line changes wrap in a `<mark>` at the `-strong` tint, `--r-2`, padding 0 1px.
- **Hunk header** — 28px, `--track`, `mono-code` `--text-tertiary`, `@@ −12,7 +12,9 @@`, with a
  24px ghost expander at the right.
- **Collapsed context** — 28px row, `--surface-inset`, `--r-6`, centred `caption`
  `⌄ 24 unchanged lines`, expanding over `--dur-3`; ⌥-click expands all.
- **Split mode** — two panes at a 1px `--line-border` divider with synchronised scroll;
  empty-side rows fill `--surface-inset` with a 3px diagonal `--line-hairline` hatch.

**Field-level variant** (typed documents, not code): each changed field renders as an
`--surface-object` row showing the field's `label-caps` name and a before/after pair. **A
table field diffs as a cell matrix** — changed cells take the role wash, unchanged stay
`--surface-raised`, with `label-caps` row and column headers. **A list field diffs as
reordered rows with a `moved ↓3` `micro` badge.** A canvas field diffs as two side-by-side
mini-grids with changed areas washed.

- **Footer** — 48px: `+n additions · −m deletions across k fields` in `micro`, and on a branch
  diff a primary `Merge` plus a ghost `Abandon branch`.
- **Conflicted hunks** take a 2px `--caution-border` left border and a
  `Keep base · Keep incoming · Edit` segmented control pinned to the hunk's top-right. **The
  resolution control shows what each side discards** — never two bare OS radios, which is
  what the highest-stakes irreversible choice in the app currently is.

*Empty*: `These revisions are identical` centred at 160px with the two long HashChips above.
*Loading*: the header renders, the body shows 12 skeleton lines with the gutter drawn.

**DiffSummary** (reused in the commit bar, branch rows, revision rows, merge dialog): `+128`
in `mono-seq` `--positive-text`, `−41` in `--critical-text`, then a 5-block bar of 8×8px
`--r-2` cells at 2px gaps filled proportionally — additions `--positive-mark`, deletions
`--critical-mark`, remainder `--track`; **any non-zero change fills at least one block.** An
unchanged diff renders `±0` in `--text-tertiary`.

---

### 9.31 Dropdown menu / popover

`--surface-overlay`, `--r-8` (popover `--r-12`), `--elev-2`, padding 4px (popover 16px),
min-width 200px, max-width 320px, max-height 60vh with internal scroll.

**Item** 34px, `--r-6`, padding 0 10px, gap 10px: a 16px icon `--text-tertiary` + `body`
`--text-secondary`, optional trailing kbd or 14px chevron. A **reserved** 20px leading slot
holds the check on checkable items so labels align whether or not one is checked.

**States** — hover / active-descendant `--state-hover` + label `--text-primary`; destructive
item label and icon `--critical-text` with hover `--critical-wash`; disabled
`--text-quaternary` with a right-aligned `micro` reason; submenu on a 120ms hover intent.
Section label `label-caps` at `8px 10px 4px`; separator a 1px `--line-hairline` with 4px
margins. Keyboard: ↑↓ roving tabindex, Home/End, type-ahead, Escape closes and returns focus
to the trigger. *Empty*: a 32px non-interactive `caption` `--text-quaternary` row.

---

### 9.32 Dialog, sheet, and confirm

**Dialog** — `--surface-overlay`, `--elev-3`, over `--surface-scrim` with `blur(2px)`.
Widths 400 (confirm) / 560 (form, default) / 720 (review). `--r-16` at ≤480px, `--r-20` above.

- **Header** — padding 24px, `title-3` (destructive: `title-1`) + a `caption`
  `--text-tertiary` subline; a 28px close × top-right; a bottom `--line-hairline` appears only
  when the body scrolls.
- **Body** — 24px padding, `max-height: 60vh`, scrolls.
- **Footer** — 64px, `border-top: 1px solid var(--line-hairline)`, `--surface-inset`, buttons
  right-aligned at 8px: ghost Cancel then primary Confirm.

**ConfirmDialog (destructive)** — the header gains a 36px `--r-12` `--critical-wash` tile with
a `--critical-text` glyph; the body states the **irreversible consequence in domain terms**
(`Revoking this key immediately breaks 3 agent lanes`); a type-to-confirm `mono` input appears
when the target is a branch, a key or a member, enabling the confirm only on an exact match;
the confirm is the product's **one** destructive-solid button. Focus is trapped, Escape
cancels, and **initial focus lands on Cancel, never on the destructive confirm.**

Every one of these currently fires from a bare ghost `icon-sm` with no confirmation: revoke
key · abandon branch · remove member · delete webhook · delete table row · discard document ·
AI whole-document overwrite. All of them route through this component.

**Sheet** — a real edge-anchored drawer: right-anchored 400px (480 ≥1600px) or, ≤768px,
bottom-anchored full-width with `--r-20` on the top corners and a 36×4 `--line-strong`
grabber. It is its own primitive; **the mobile navigation may not be a centred Dialog with
seven overridden classes and an inherited absolute close button landing on the wordmark**,
which is what ships today.

---

### 9.33 Toast

Bottom-right (bottom-centre ≤768px), 16px from the edges, 8px gaps, **max 3 visible** with a
`+N more` collapsed row. 320–420px, `--surface-overlay`, `--r-12`, `--elev-2`, padding
14px 16px.

Anatomy: a 16px role glyph (or a 16px spinner for in-flight work) · a text block of
`body-strong` title over `caption` `--text-tertiary` detail clamped to 2 lines · an optional
`caption-strong` inline action · a 24px ghost dismiss ×. A 2px `--r-full` `--text-quaternary`
progress hairline along the bottom edge counts down the dismissal; **`critical` toasts have no
hairline and never auto-dismiss.** Hover or `focus-within` pauses every timer.
`role="status"` for neutral/positive, `role="alert"` for critical.

**A commit-success toast always carries the new revision's HashChip and a `View revision`
action.**

---

### 9.34 Command palette

640px, `--r-20`, `--elev-3`, `--surface-overlay`, anchored 15vh from the top over the scrim.

- **Input row** 52px, borderless, 20px leading magnifier, 16px/400 text, a trailing `esc` kbd,
  `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--line-hairline)`.
- **Results** grouped under `label-caps` headers — `DOCUMENTS · TEMPLATES · DEPARTMENTS ·
  BRANCHES · KEYS · ACTIONS` — each 44px, `--r-6`, padding 0 12px, gap 12px: a
  DepartmentChip in a persistent left gutter + `body` title + a right-aligned `mono-hash`
  path (`marketing/positioning-brief`) and, for committed documents, a `mono-seq`.
  **Matched ranges are highlighted with a `--state-selected` background — never bold, never
  coloured.**
- **Footer** 40px, `--surface-inset`, `micro` legend `↑↓ navigate · ↵ open · ⌘↵ new tab · esc
  close`.

**A full keyboard contract is mandatory and is currently absent entirely:** a selected index,
ArrowUp/ArrowDown, Home/End, Enter to open, `role="listbox"`/`role="option"` and
`aria-activedescendant`. The active row takes `--state-selected` + a 2px `--text-primary`
left bar. Hover also sets selection.

**States** — *idle (no query)*: a `RECENT` group of the last 5 documents plus 4 quick actions;
never an empty box. *searching*: a 2px indeterminate hairline under the input. *no results*: a
120px block echoing the query in `mono-hash` plus a `Create a document named "…"` action.
*truncated*: a `micro` footer note when the server capped the result set, so a complete answer
is distinguishable from a clipped one.

**The palette passes the current `?b=` branch to `api.search.docs`.** It currently accepts a
branch argument and never sends one, so on a branch ⌘K silently searches main.

---

### 9.35 Banner / callout

Full width inside its container, `--r-12`, padding 14px 16px, `--{role}-wash` ground,
`1px solid var(--{role}-border)`, and a **3px `--{role}-mark` bar on the left edge**, `--r-2`,
inset 1px. Contents: a 20px `--{role}-text` glyph · a text block of `body-strong`
`--text-primary` title over `caption` `--text-secondary` · a right-aligned ghost action
and/or a 24px dismiss ×.

Product uses: `unconverted spend` (critical) · key expiring in 3 days (caution) · merge
conflict present (critical) · viewing a historical revision (caution, **non-dismissible,
sticky under the top bar**) · editing on a branch overlay (agent, non-dismissible) ·
AI/media not configured (neutral, with a real action, never a Card with no content).
Dismissals persist per user per object id; a non-dismissible banner has no ×.

---

### 9.36 Skeleton

`--track` fill, radius **matched to the element being replaced** (text `--r-4`, tiles and
cards their own radius, avatars `--r-full`). Geometry is **identical to the final content** —
same row heights, same column widths, same card radius, same rail spine and node positions —
so the swap causes zero layout shift. Text-bar widths come from a fixed set (96%, 72%, 58%,
40%, 30%) chosen **deterministically from the row index**, so the pattern does not flicker
between renders.

Animation: `opacity 1 → 0.62` over 1200ms `--ease-move` infinite alternate — **a pulse, never
a travelling shimmer**. **After 8 seconds the pulse stops and the skeleton holds static.**
Content replaces skeletons with a 90ms opacity crossfade. **Never render a skeleton for a
transition under 200ms** — below that, render nothing and let the content land.

The current `<Skeleton className="h-96" />` — a single 384px grey slab standing in for a
canvas, a 14-field record, a table and a timeline alike — is deleted. `SkeletonTable`,
`SkeletonRail`, `SkeletonCanvas`, `SkeletonRecord`, `SkeletonStatStrip` and `SkeletonNav`
each mirror their landed geometry.

---

### 9.37 Empty state

A centred column, `max-width: 400px`, padding 48px 24px (32px inside a card, 96px full-page),
`text-align: center`.

**Anatomy:** a 48px `--r-14` `--surface-inset` icon tile with a 24px `--text-tertiary` glyph ·
16px · `title-4` (page-level: `title-1`) headline naming the **object and its verb** ·
8px · `caption` `--text-secondary` body, max 2 lines, stating what will appear here and why ·
20px · one 36px primary button and at most one ghost secondary. Full-page states add a
left-aligned 3-item numbered `caption` `--text-tertiary` list of what happens next.

**On version-control surfaces only** — timeline, document history, branch list, diff — the
icon tile is replaced by **git's empty-tree hash**,
`4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904`, set in `mono-hash` `--text-quaternary`, wrapped to
two lines, with a 1px `--line-hairline` struck horizontally through its centre. It is a
literal statement that nothing has been committed yet, it costs no asset, and it teaches the
data model. *(It is the empty **tree**, not the empty blob `e69de29b…` — the two are commonly
confused and only the tree is correct here.)* Everywhere else — a finance department at zero
data, an empty media panel — uses the neutral tile, because a git in-joke is not the mark a
CFO should meet first.

**No illustrations. No mascots. No exclamation marks. No marketing copy.**

The five variants are specified in §11.3.

---

### 9.38 Small parts

**Count badge** — 18px min-width, `--r-full`, `--surface-inset`, `micro` tabular
`--text-secondary`, padding 0 5px, caps at `99+`. **Zero renders as `0`, never hidden.** On an
inverted parent it flips to `--state-active` over the inverted fill.

**Kbd** — 20px min-width, `--r-4`, `--surface-inset`, `1px solid var(--line-hairline)` with a
2px `--line-border` bottom edge (a subtle keycap), padding 0 5px, `mono-micro`
`--text-tertiary`. Chords are separate elements at 3px gaps with **no `+` character**.

**Tag** — 20px, `--r-4`, `--surface-inset`, `mono-hash` `--text-secondary`, padding 0 6px.
Square-ish, because a kind slug is an identifier, not a state.

**Tooltip** — `--surface-inverse` ground, `--text-inverse` text, `--r-8`, padding 6px 10px,
`caption`, max-width 260px, no arrow, `--elev-2`. 400ms hover intent (0ms if a sibling is
already open), 0ms on focus-visible, dismisses on blur/leave/Escape. **Never contains
interactive content** — that is a popover. Replaces every native `title=` attribute in the
codebase.

**Separator** — a 1px `--line-hairline` rule; horizontal full-bleed inside its container, or
vertical at 18–20px tall with 12px margins. Uses the installed-but-unimported
`@radix-ui/react-separator`.

**Breadcrumb, ScrollArea, Tabs, Popover, Label** — all five Radix packages are already
installed with **zero imports**; they are wrapped here rather than re-implemented.

---

## 10. PAGE ARCHETYPES

### 10.1 The partition rule

> **Every archetype occupies a silhouette used exactly once.** Each is implemented as a real
> layout component (`<AtlasLayout>`, `<WorkbenchLayout>`, `<LedgerStreamLayout>`, …) that owns
> its grid and its container mode. **Ad-hoc page-level grid CSS is a review failure.** An
> archetype that cannot be named is a page that should not ship.

Each archetype below therefore declares not only what it *is* but **what it denies itself**,
naming the sibling it must never be mistaken for. Sixteen routes, sixteen archetypes. This is
the direct antidote to the audit's core finding: today `/timeline` and `/runs` contain the
byte-identical string `absolute left-[11px] top-7 h-full w-px bg-border`, and ten of eleven
pages open with the same two lines of markup.

Three archetypes are permitted to alter the chassis itself — **only these three**: COMPARISON
MATRIX and INGESTION CONSOLE collapse the sidebar to 64px to buy horizontal room; COMPOSER
and GENESIS SHEET suppress the shell entirely.

### 10.2 The sixteen

**A1 · SPECIMEN SHEET** — *container `bleed`.* The registry shown as evidence rather than
described in prose. A full-bleed scrollable catalog: a department index where each of the 11
views shows glyph + label + its `description` sentence + its group names + its true kind
count (18/15/23/19/10/18/8/7/6/6/6); **at least one real canvas kind drawn at true fidelity
from its own `layout.areas`**; one real table field rendered with its actual `TableColumn`
headers; and a commit strip showing message, author, `#0142` and hash exactly as `revisions`
stores them. **Denies itself:** a centred hero, a three-up value-prop card grid, and a KPI
strip. It is the only page with no tenant, therefore the only place the registry appears
*unfiltered* — every in-app page shows one company's coverage *of* it.

**A2 · GATE** — *container `prose`, shell suppressed.* A 380px credential panel, vertically
centred, that **names the destination it will restore** (`continue to acme / agents`, read
from `?next`). Two fields with real `<label>`s, one primary, one footer link. **Denies
itself:** any disclosure. Where ENROLMENT expands, GATE contracts — it has no policy to
satisfy, no consequence to explain and no downstream step to preview.

**A3 · ENROLMENT** — *container `prose`, shell suppressed.* A 480px two-block panel: the
credential form **plus an identity preview** rendering the literal `authorLabel` string this
account will produce, set in the exact typographic treatment the commit rail uses
(`Ada Lovelace` vs `ada@example.com`), so the optional name field shows its permanent
consequence without a word of explanation. The password policy renders as a **live
three-item checklist** (≥10 characters · ≥1 letter · ≥1 digit), all three of which the server
already enforces and two of which are invisible today. **Denies itself:** GATE's minimalism.
This creates a person in the ledger; it should feel weighty.

**A4 · REPOSITORY INDEX** — *container `page`.* A dense, sortable, comparison-oriented data
table: one row per company, `mono-hash` slug, role as a leading column, right-aligned tabular
`documentCount` **rendered against `KINDS.length` as a coverage meter**, `commitCount`, and a
recency column that reads as a scale. **Denies itself:** a card grid. Home's only job is
cross-row comparison, and a 2-up grid of cards destroys exactly the column alignment that
makes comparison possible.

**A5 · PROVISIONING FORM** — *container `page`.* Two columns: fields left; on the right a
**live "what will be created" manifest** — the resolved `/c/<slug>` URL in mono derived by the
importable `slugify()`, the owner membership row, the literal first event message
`Founded {name}`, and the six kinds the founding interview will commit next, pulled by id from
`lib/kinds`. **Denies itself:** the plain vertical form. This is the only irreversible
namespace decision in the product — no mutation anywhere can rename a slug — and the only
form whose output is an identity rather than content.

**A6 · ATLAS** — *container `page`.* A company **masthead over a coverage ledger**: an identity
block where `mission` is set as real typography (not a 14px bordered aside); one dominant
coverage instrument rendering the true three-state classification per template
(essential-and-committed / committed / untouched) at **real per-department cardinalities**
(6→23), as 11 segmented meters — never eleven equal cards with equal hairlines; the economics
brief as the page's one typographically loud number, because it is the only *measurement*
here rather than a count of the registry; and a **full-width** commit log with seq, hash,
actor kind, department chip and a link to the document. **Denies itself:** a stat strip *above*
the coverage instrument, and a 20rem sidebar for the commit feed. It is a repo front page, not
a KPI dashboard.

**A7 · LANE CONSOLE** — *container `page`.* A per-department instrument strip locked above an
**adaptive** catalog. The strip is genuinely per-department: coverage as a three-state meter,
and — for the five departments that can *never* produce signals (brand, product, people, legal,
technology, because only 8 of 136 kinds carry a signal-bearing table) — a substitute built from
what they do have: the fill-ratio distribution across their documents, staleness against the
45-day threshold, and canvas/table composition. The catalog's column count **tracks group
cardinality** (real groups run 1→8 kinds), and tiles are content-bearing: fill meter, field-type
fingerprint, head commit message, `#0142`, branch-override and archived flags — **never the
registry's generic blurb**, which is identical for every company. **Denies itself:** ATLAS's
aggregate coverage and a fixed 3-column grid.

**A8 · WORKBENCH** — *container `page` + `prose` body.* Two welded rails: an always-visible
**commit spine** (§9.23) locked against a typed content body whose internal geometry is chosen
**per template** — canvas frame for the 15 layout kinds, reading record for prose-dominant
kinds, ledger grid for the 120 table fields — plus the persistent commit bar. Clicking a rail
node time-travels the body into a read-only state announced by a sticky caution Banner.
**Denies itself:** a single-axis layout. It is the only surface where the user *writes*, the
only one whose content shape is polymorphic across 137 declared schemas, and the only one
where two orthogonal axes — structure and history — must be legible simultaneously.

**A9 · GENESIS SHEET** — *full-viewport focus route, shell suppressed, URL-addressable and
back-button-safe.* A 52px bar (close × left, `title-compact` centre, step counter right), a
2px top-edge progress meter, then a 640px column: the kind's identity at full weight; the
**typed field guide legible as a schema** (every field's label, type and hint); the title
presented as the thing that mints the document's permanent slug, **with a live slug preview
and a uniqueness check against siblings**; an optional "draft from N committed documents" step
that names its sources; and one irreversible primary framed as `Create at revision #0001`.
**Denies itself:** WORKBENCH's history rail, hash, branch state and completeness — every one
of which is definitionally absent here. It is the only purely prospective page in the product.
*(It also fixes a live bug: because `docSlug` is null, the current commit omits it and the
server falls back to `kind`, so "create a second product" overwrites the first.)*

**A10 · LEDGER STREAM** — *container `page`.* A three-zone commit tape: (1) a top strip of
aggregates only this page can own — per-day commit histogram, per-department distribution
across the 11 views, human-vs-agent split; (2) a persistent left **revision rail** with sticky
`label-caps` day/week group headers on the canvas, so the vertical axis is calibrated time
rather than uniform padding; (3) rows as true aligned columns, with `#0142` and the hash in a
fixed-width right block so machine identity reads as a straight edge. **Rows live in one card
per day-group** — the group header sits on the canvas, the rows do not. **Denies itself:** the
mission grouping of MISSION INSPECTOR and any per-object aggregate. It is the only unbounded,
append-only, time-primary dataset in the app.

**A11 · COMPARISON MATRIX** — *container `bleed`, sidebar collapsed to 64px.* The only surface
defined by its relationship to *another* version of the world, so it holds two simultaneous
truths. A compact left index of branches (open pinned and live; merged and abandoned collapsed
into a settled register carrying `mergedAt`) beside a **full-width diff page, not a modal**.
Per-document rows are grouped by the 11 departments using the `entry.view` the query already
returns, and each row draws a **revision ruler with three marks** — fork point
(`forkedFromSeq`), branch head (`branchRevision`), main head (`mainRevision`) — so "main moved
underneath" is a picture instead of the string `branch r3 · forked at main r1 · main now r4`.
Conflicts promote to a resolution ledger with an explicit unresolved count. **Denies itself:**
a vertical stack of equal cards, and the 672×320 dialog the most valuable screen in the product
currently lives inside.

**A12 · CREDENTIAL CONSOLE** — *container `page`.* Two registers stacked, plus a form rail. (1)
A fixed **connection spec sheet**: endpoint, transport, protocol version `context-ledger.v1`,
the literal `Authorization: Bearer cos_…` form, and the ten MCP tools as a typed capability
grid split read (6) / write (4) with their real caps — **derived from `TOOLS`, not retyped as
prose.** (2) A credential table whose primary axis is the **11-department lane grid**: one row
per key with lane coverage as an 11-cell segmented meter (filled = writable, full width =
unrestricted), scope as a hard column rather than a chip, and issued → last-used → expires
drawn as a lifecycle bar so dormancy and imminent expiry are shapes, not sentences. The right
rail **holds inputs** (the issue-key form) rather than a readout — the only archetype where it
does. Webhooks split off into a sibling delivery-health panel rendering the last 20 outcomes
from `webhooks.deliveries`, **a query that exists and is called by nothing today**, which is
why the UI can say a delivery failed and never why. **Denies itself:** MISSION INSPECTOR's
master-detail. Nothing else in the product has an object whose value literally cannot be shown
twice.

**A13 · MISSION INSPECTOR** — *container `page`.* Master-detail, not a feed. Runs are the only
bounded, nested, numeric dataset in the product: rows roll up by `runId` into missions — first
event → last event, duration, event-type histogram, terminal state — using the
`by_company_run` index the schema already ships for exactly this. A dense run table with a
type-lane strip and economics columns (tokens observed, accepted receipts, tokens/receipt with
the threshold ramp, `unconverted_spend` as a hard flag) sits beside a detail pane showing the
selected run's ordered events with a **typed payload renderer** — known keys as metrics,
unknown keys as a key/value table, raw JSON as the *fallback* rather than the default.
`actorLabel` links back to the issuing agent key. **Denies itself:** LEDGER STREAM's rail and
day-grouping entirely. Timeline is one continuous human history where every row is equal;
Runs is a set of discrete machine executions whose value is aggregation and cross-run
comparison.

**A14 · ACCESS ROSTER** — *container `prose`.* The smallest, most static and most consequential
dataset, and the only one whose interesting structure is **hierarchy rather than time**. The
roster is segmented and ordered by tier (Owners → Admins → Members) with counts per tier, as
**inset grouped lists** (§9.14), beside an explicit **capability grid** rendering the authority
model itself — invite · remove members · remove admins · grant admin · commit · read — so the
four rules the server enforces are legible **before** anyone violates one, rather than arriving
as a `toast.error` after the click. A membership audit strip (`member_added` / `member_removed`)
sits below. **Denies itself:** every scanning, comparison-driven affordance of A12 and A13. This
page should read as **settled** — a short list that resolves at a single glance.

**A15 · INGESTION CONSOLE** — *container `bleed`, sidebar collapsed to 64px.* The only page whose
output is a **set of proposed writes**, so it needs a before/after tension no other page has.
Left: a real source workspace — multi-source (paste + file drop), each chunk labelled, counted
live against the true 200 000-character server cap. The `note` field is promoted from an
afterthought input to a first-class steering field. Right: a persistent **registry target
panel** showing 11 departments × 136 kinds as a density map, dimmed at rest, resolving in place
on completion into a per-department extraction manifest where **committed / skipped /
silently-truncated are three visually distinct states** (the server slices at 40 documents with
no signal in the return value — the UI must show it). Between them, a genuine long-running-task
strip: elapsed, stage, cancel. **Denies itself:** a single 288px textarea. This is the only page
in the app that blocks on a minute-long server action.

**A16 · COMPOSER** — *full viewport, shell suppressed entirely.* The only page in the app where
nothing exists yet: no history, no branch, no search, no documents. It is therefore the only
route that suppresses the AppShell — wrapping the emptiest possible chrome (a sidebar listing
11 departments and 136 unfilled templates, a ⌘K over a store with zero documents) around the
single most important moment in the product is the current design's worst structural mistake.
Left: a persistent numbered stack of **all nine questions**, editable in place with
answered/unanswered state, so the founder always sees the whole interview instead of stepping
±1 through a peephole. Right: a **live manifest of the six documents being composed**, each
with its true registry title from `kindTemplate()`, its complete field list, and a live
indication of which fields this answer populates — **plus a visible strike-through when a blank
answer is about to drop an entire document**, which the `hasContent` guard does silently today.
The three newline-split answers (`targets`, `differentiation`, `channels`) get a real list
editor; the other six get a prose editor, because the server draws that distinction and the
founder currently cannot see it. **Denies itself:** the wizard peephole and the 4px progress
hairline that restates in pixels what the eyebrow already says in words.

### 10.3 Supporting archetypes (not among the sixteen routes)

- **SEQUENCE DETAIL** — *(`/c/[slug]/timeline/[rev]`)* one revision rendered as a document: a
  `label-caps` `REVISION` kicker, the sequence number at `metric-lg`, the message at `title-1`,
  an authorship stamp, the long HashChip, the BranchChip, the DiffSummary, then a ruled list of
  changed documents, then the unified diff inline. **Explicitly no tabs — a commit is one
  immutable thing and cannot be paginated.**
- **FOCUS DIALOG** — a modality, not a page: a deep-linkable route rendering as a dialog **over
  the archetype beneath it, which stays fully visible at 100% behind the scrim**. Used for
  Commit, Merge branch, Issue key, Revert revision and every destructive confirm. Some actions
  must not lose the page you are acting on, which a full-viewport takeover always does.
- **BLANK SLATE** — a **substitution rule**, not a block inside a page. At zero commits it
  replaces ATLAS, LANE CONSOLE, LEDGER STREAM and COMPARISON MATRIX **wholesale**: a
  full-viewport centred 420px column with the empty-tree glyph, a `title-1` headline, a
  `caption` body, one primary and one ghost action, and beneath them three suggested first
  commits drawn against a 28px rail stub with **hollow nodes — the future history, rendered
  empty**. It is the product's proof that zero-data was designed, not patched.

### 10.4 Route → archetype map

| Route | Archetype | Container | Why it differs from its neighbours |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | **A1 SPECIMEN SHEET** | `bleed` | The only page with no tenant, so the only one that can show the 136-template registry *unfiltered* — every in-app page shows one company's coverage of it. |
| `/signin` | **A2 GATE** | `prose`, no shell | Zero disclosure obligations; its only real datum is `?next`, so it contracts to a destination-naming credential panel. |
| `/signup` | **A3 ENROLMENT** | `prose`, no shell | Carries two obligations GATE lacks — a three-rule password policy and a name field that becomes the permanent commit byline — so it expands where GATE contracts. |
| `/home` | **A4 REPOSITORY INDEX** | `page` | The only account-scoped, cross-tenant page; *n* rows of one uniform shape whose job is comparison, unlike `/c/[slug]`, which is one entity in depth. |
| `/new` | **A5 PROVISIONING FORM** | `page` | The only form that creates a *namespace* rather than content, and the only irreversible identifier in the product — so it pairs fields with a consequence manifest. |
| `/c/[slug]` | **A6 ATLAS** | `page` | The only route where all 11 ViewMetas and all 136 templates are in scope at once, and the only one holding the company's prose identity and the cross-department economics snapshot. |
| `/c/[slug]/[view]` | **A7 LANE CONSOLE** | `page` | Per-document within one registry slice with branch-overlay semantics — inventory-with-state, which nothing else is; ATLAS has no per-document granularity, WORKBENCH shows no inventory. |
| `/c/[slug]/[view]/[doc]` | **A8 WORKBENCH** | `page` + `prose` body | The only surface where the user *writes*, the only one whose geometry is chosen per-template from registry data, and the only one holding two orthogonal axes at once. |
| `/c/[slug]/[view]/new` | **A9 GENESIS SHEET** | full viewport | Purely prospective: no head, no history, no hash, no branch state, no meaningful completeness — every load-bearing element of WORKBENCH is definitionally absent. |
| `/c/[slug]/timeline` | **A10 LEDGER STREAM** | `page` | The only unbounded, append-only, time-primary dataset; calibrated by day rather than grouped by object, which is precisely what separates it from `/runs`. |
| `/c/[slug]/branches` | **A11 COMPARISON MATRIX** | `bleed`, nav 64px | The only surface that must hold two simultaneous truths and force a choice between them; every other screen renders exactly one state of the world. |
| `/c/[slug]/agents` | **A12 CREDENTIAL CONSOLE** | `page` | The only page whose subject is a *secret* — one-time reveal, irreversibility, scope and expiry *are* the information design — and the only one needing a permanent 11-lane authorization axis. |
| `/c/[slug]/runs` | **A13 MISSION INSPECTOR** | `page` | The only bounded, nested, numeric dataset: rows roll up by `runId` into missions and the numbers demand cross-run comparison, not chronological reading. |
| `/c/[slug]/members` | **A14 ACCESS ROSTER** | `prose` | The only dataset whose structure is hierarchy rather than time, and the only page that should read as *settled* — the opposite register from A12 and A13, whose row recipe it currently shares byte for byte. |
| `/c/[slug]/import` | **A15 INGESTION CONSOLE** | `bleed`, nav 64px | The only page whose output is a set of *proposed writes*, and the only one that blocks on a minute-long server action — so it alone needs a source pane, a target map and a task strip. |
| `/c/[slug]/found` | **A16 COMPOSER** | full viewport, no shell | The only page whose job is to make the ledger *exist*; every other route presupposes history, revisions, branches and search, so it is the only one that suppresses the shell entirely. |

## 11. EMPTY, LOADING AND ERROR STATES

### 11.1 The governing rule

> **The empty-state contract is declared per COMPONENT, not per page**, so a page inherits
> correct emptiness by construction rather than by someone remembering. Every component in §9
> declares its zero-data rendering; a component whose spec does not is incomplete and does not
> ship.

This is a real workload — sixteen archetypes × four variants ≈ sixty states — and the ones
that get skipped are always the boring ones: an empty right-rail value, an empty stat-strip
cell, a two-point sparkline, a filter chip whose count is zero. Those are named explicitly
below so they cannot be forgotten.

### 11.2 The frame always renders

**Chrome that describes the shape of absent data must still draw.** An empty gauge is a gauge.

| Component | Zero-data rendering |
|---|---|
| Stat-strip cell | `—` at `metric-xl` in `--text-tertiary`; sparkline → a dashed hairline; delta row → `no prior period`. **The strip never hides.** |
| Chart | Gridlines, axes and axis labels **still render**; a centred `caption` line plus a ghost range-widening action fills the plot. |
| Sparkline | A 1px dashed `--line-hairline` at the vertical centre. **Never a flat line at the baseline** — that falsely reads as measured zero. |
| Data table | Header row **retained** (column meaning survives); a full-span 240px cell holds the EmptyState; the footer hides. |
| Meter | An empty track with a 2px `--line-hairline` left stub and `0` — never a sliver, never absent. |
| Right-rail card | Header retained; every value `—`; the footer button **promotes from secondary to primary**, because it is now the only action. |
| Filter chip | A count of `0` renders `(0)`; the bar renders a disabled `All (0)` chip rather than disappearing. |
| Count badge / tab count | `0`, never hidden. Absence and zero are different facts. |
| **Revision rail** | **The spine is not drawn at all.** A rail with no commits is a lie about history. |
| Command palette (idle) | `RECENT` (5 documents) + 4 quick actions. Never an empty box. |
| Sidebar | Departments with zero committed documents still render, with their coverage meter at zero — the registry is the product's principal asset and hiding it hides the point. |

### 11.3 The five empty variants

Every list, table, chart, rail, tab panel and page **must declare which of these it renders.**
They differ in tile, copy and — critically — **in primary action.**

1. **NEVER-CREATED** — neutral 48px tile (or the empty-tree glyph on VCS surfaces). Headline
   names the object and its verb: `No revisions yet` · `This branch touches nothing` ·
   `No agent keys issued`. Body states what will appear here and what creating one does.
   Primary action **creates**.
2. **FILTERED-OUT** — 32px tile. Headline `No documents match these filters`. Body **echoes the
   active filters**. Primary action is `Clear filters`, styled **secondary**, because clearing
   is not creation. **The filter chips stay visible above.** This is a distinct state from
   never-created and must never reuse its copy — the current timeline says
   `No commits in this department yet` when the truth is `not in the last 200 events`, which
   is a falsehood the design prints.
3. **PERMISSION** — neutral tile. Headline `This department lane is not in your scope`, body
   naming the lane. **No create action**; a ghost `Request access`.
4. **ERROR** — a `--critical-wash` tile with a `--critical-text` glyph. Headline
   `Couldn't load revisions`. Body carries the error id in `mono-hash`. Primary `Retry`, ghost
   `Copy error id`.
5. **SEARCH-ZERO** — 32px tile. The query echoed in `mono-hash` inside the body line, plus a
   `Create a document named "…"` action.

**BLANK SLATE (§10.3) supersedes all five** at whole-workspace zero: when a company has no
commits at all, the archetype itself is replaced rather than a block being inserted into it.

### 11.4 Loading

1. **Skeletons match final geometry exactly** — same row heights, same column widths, same card
   radius, same rail spine and node positions — so resolution causes **zero CLS**. The current
   `h-24`, `h-64`, `h-96` magic-number slabs resemble nothing that lands and make every page
   visibly jump.
2. **Frame first, content second.** Table headers, chart axes and gridlines, page headers,
   stat-strip labels and the sidebar's structure all render live; only the *values* are
   skeletons. The user learns the shape of the answer while waiting for it.
3. **Nothing under 200ms.** Below that threshold render nothing and let the content land.
4. **Nothing forever.** After 8 seconds the pulse stops and the skeleton holds static: a stuck
   request must look stuck.
5. **Two loading philosophies on one screen is a defect.** The department page currently
   renders a correctly-shaped 3-tile skeleton above a single 384px grey rectangle; a page
   picks one and applies it everywhere.
6. **In-flight actions keep their geometry.** A loading button locks its width and keeps its
   label; a submitting commit bar keeps its exact height; a form's inputs **disable** rather
   than remaining live and re-submittable.

### 11.5 Errors

- **Field-level errors render at the field**, wired with `aria-invalid` and
  `aria-describedby` — never only as a toast in the opposite corner of the screen. Every
  failure mode of `/new` (empty name, malformed slug, taken slug) is field-level and all three
  currently route to a disappearing snackbar.
- **Preconditions that are knowable before work begins are stated before work begins.** Role
  denial and "this company already has committed context" are structural facts, not outcomes;
  they belong in the page, not in a toast after nine answered questions.
- **Never discard the server's message.** `catch { setError("Sign-in failed…") }` with an
  unbound catch destroys a correct, specific, already-written server message and replaces it
  with a guess — including the one case where the real message names the actual rule
  (`Passwords need at least one letter and one digit`).
- **Unconfigured-service states are product UI, not developer output.** A missing
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or Wasabi credential renders a neutral Banner with a real action and a
  one-sentence explanation — never a bare Card with a header, no content, no action, and four
  `<code>` env-var names in the middle of a document page.
- **Toasts are for outcomes of actions the user just took**, never for state a page could have
  shown. `critical` toasts never auto-dismiss.

## 12. ACCESSIBILITY

### 12.1 Contrast — measured, not asserted

Every value in §2–§4 has been computed. The **minimums** this language guarantees:

| Class | Minimum | Measured range |
|---|---|---|
| Body and meta text on any surface it can land on | **4.5:1** | light 4.92 → 18.11 · dark 4.88 → 17.85 |
| `--text-quaternary` (non-informational only) | **3.0:1** | light 3.03 → 3.39 · dark 3.27 → 3.67 |
| Signal `-text` on card, canvas **and its own wash** | **4.5:1** | light 5.57 → 8.08 · dark 5.99 → 10.37 |
| Signal `-mark` as a graphical object | **3.0:1** | light 3.39 → 5.57 · dark 5.07 → 7.59 |
| Chart series strokes | **3.0:1** | light 3.70 → 10.91 · dark 5.20 → 13.01 |
| Diff ink on its own row background | **4.5:1** | light 7.04 → 8.50 · dark 8.17 → 8.40 |
| Button labels on their fills | **4.5:1** | 5.38 → 18.11 |
| Focus ring against any ground | **3.0:1** | 15.49 → 17.41 |

`--text-tertiary` is verified against the **darkest ground it can ever sit on** — `--track`,
not merely the card — because a component that puts caption text on a segmented-control track
or a meter label must not silently drop below AA. That check is what the earlier candidate
`#667080` failed at 4.12:1.

**Non-text separation** (surfaces, diff row tints) is informational rather than
WCAG-regulated; the language holds surfaces to ≥1.04 and, where separation is thinner than
1.10, **mandates a 1px border as the second cue** — `--surface-object` in both modes, and every
dark elevated surface.

### 12.2 Colour is never the sole carrier

- Every **status dot** is followed by a text label at 6px.
- Every **diff line** carries a `+`/`−` glyph **and** a 3px positional gutter bar in addition
  to its tint.
- Every **delta** carries a ▲/▼ glyph as well as its colour.
- **Human vs agent** is carried by *shape* (round vs square, §5.3), which survives greyscale,
  colour-blindness and print — not by violet alone.
- **Departments** are carried by glyph and label, never hue.
- Every **threshold value** prints its unit and, on hover, its band name.

A greyscale screenshot of any screen in this product must remain fully decodable. If it does
not, the screen has a colour-only encoding and is a review failure.

### 12.3 Focus

- **`:focus-visible` only** — never `:focus` — using the two-stop monochrome ring:
  `box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px <ground token>, 0 0 0 4px var(--focus-ring)`. The first stop takes
  the token of the surface the control actually sits on, so the offset gap reads on canvas,
  card, inset, track and inverted fills alike.
- **Every interactive element has one.** `buttonVariants` currently contains **zero** focus
  classes, so every button, dropdown trigger and icon control in the shell is invisible to
  keyboard focus; `--ring` is consumed by exactly one primitive.
- `outline-none` without a replacement is a review failure. It currently appears on the
  company switcher — the control that changes tenant.
- **Focus is never destroyed by an action.** Closing a menu, dialog or palette returns focus to
  its trigger. Dialogs trap focus; a destructive dialog places initial focus on **Cancel**.
- **A skip link is the first focusable element in the document**, targeting the `id="main"`
  that already exists and that nothing currently references. Without it, a keyboard user tabs
  through a company switcher, a branch picker, 11 department links and up to 23 template links
  before reaching content, on every page load.

### 12.4 Keyboard

- **The command palette has a full contract** (§9.34): selection index, ↑↓, Home/End, Enter,
  `role="listbox"`/`option`, `aria-activedescendant`. Today it has none — you open it with ⌘K
  and must reach for the mouse.
- Segmented controls: ←/→ move selection, Home/End jump. Tabs: ←/→ move focus, Enter/Space
  activate. Menus: ↑↓ roving tabindex plus type-ahead. Tables: rows are focusable, ↑↓ traverse,
  Enter opens.
- The DataGrid supports arrow/tab/enter cell traversal and paste-from-TSV; list fields support
  space-to-grab and ↑↓ to reorder.
- **Every destructive action is reachable without hover.** Hover-only controls
  (`hidden group-hover:block` on media delete, table row actions) are unreachable on touch and
  invisible to keyboard users; the pattern is `opacity-0` + `group-hover:opacity-100` +
  `group-focus-within:opacity-100`, with permanent visibility on coarse pointers.

### 12.5 Hit targets

**28px minimum** in dense contexts · **36px** default · **44px** for primary actions and all
coarse-pointer targets. Where the visual box is smaller than required, expand with an
invisible `::before { inset: -8px }` — never by growing the visual box (§6.5).

### 12.6 Semantics

- Real `<label for>` on every control. `@radix-ui/react-label` is installed with zero imports;
  the auth forms currently have **no label elements at all** and are labelled only by
  placeholders, which vanish on input and are not a reliable accessible name.
- `<time dateTime>` on every timestamp, with the absolute value in `title` **and** a tooltip.
- Headings form a correct outline: `CardTitle` takes an `as` prop rather than hardcoding `h3`.
- Each `<nav>` carries an `aria-label`; disclosure buttons carry `aria-expanded` and
  `aria-controls`; the mobile navigation Sheet is titled `Navigation`, not the wordmark markup.
- Tables use real `<table>/<thead>/<th scope>` with `aria-sort` on sortable headers.
- Icon-only buttons carry `aria-label`; decorative SVG carries `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Live regions: toasts `role="status"` (`role="alert"` for critical); a submitting commit bar
  sets `aria-busy`.
- Per-route `generateMetadata`, so a tab in a multi-company workspace does not read
  `Company OS` on all sixteen routes.

### 12.7 Zoom, reflow and motion

- The entire system must be walked at **200% browser zoom** and at **320px width** before ship.
  `label-caps` at 11px is never the sole carrier of meaning; it always sits beside a value.
- Wide content — tables, diffs, canvases, code blocks — scrolls **inside its own container**.
  The page body never scrolls horizontally.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is honoured per §7.5, and **nothing becomes
  non-functional** under it.
- `color-scheme` is set on `:root` for both modes so native form controls, scrollbars and
  portalled content do not desync during a theme flip.

## 13. ANTI-PATTERNS

A reviewer may reject a pull request by citing a numbered line here.

### 13.1 Surface and elevation

1. **A card darker than the page.** `bg-muted/50` on a `#ffffff` ground. This inversion is
   defect zero (§2.6).
2. **A card with no border and no shadow**, floating on nothing.
3. **The sidebar and a card sharing a fill.** `aside` and `Card` are both `bg-muted/50` today,
   so a card in the content area reads as a piece of the sidebar that came loose.
4. **A card inside a card.** Subdivide with `--surface-inset` or `--surface-object` and a
   hairline; never a second shadowed box.
5. **An inset dropped directly on the canvas** — you skipped a card (§2.1).
6. **Nesting deeper than `canvas → raised → (inset|object)`.**
7. **A stat strip built as four separate shadowed cards with gaps.** Cells are divided by
   **vertical rules inside one container** (§9.7).
8. **A shadow on the sidebar**, a row, a chip, a tab, a stat cell or a `--surface-object` row.
9. **A static card that lifts on hover.** Only cards that navigate change elevation, and they
   change shadow and border — never `translateY`.
10. **A dark elevated surface without both its border and its inset top highlight.**

### 13.2 Colour

11. **Any hue on structural chrome or a primary action** — a blue button, a blue active nav
    item, a blue tab underline, a blue focus ring, a blue link.
12. **A tinted icon tile that carries no state.**
13. **Departments distinguished by colour.** Eleven hues collide with the six status roles and
    become decoration.
14. **A hue with no semantic token name** — a raw hex literal or a `bg-blue-500`-style utility
    under `app/**` or `components/**`.
15. **An accent token that equals the foreground.** `--accent: #0a0a0a` is identical to
    `--foreground: #0a0a0a`, so nine `text-accent` / `border-accent/40` call sites — the nav's
    `start` marker, branch status, write-scope keys, revision badges, the founding progress bar
    — render as plain body text. Same for `--success` (= foreground) and `--warning`
    (= muted-foreground): an "alarm" border indistinguishable from a default border is worse
    than none.
16. **A status carried by colour alone**, with no adjacent label.
17. **A diff row without its `+`/`−` marker and gutter bar.**
18. **`positive` green or `critical` red used as a chart series colour.**
19. **A second destructive-solid button.** There is exactly one in the product.
20. **A threshold ramp applied to a row background or cell fill** rather than to the value text.

### 13.3 Typography

21. **An ad-hoc `text-[13px]`.** Every size resolves to a role. The codebase currently has
    seven undeclared sizes across 188 call sites.
22. **Uppercase below 11px**, or uppercase at any size without positive tracking.
23. **Geist Mono with negative tracking.**
24. **A non-tabular numeral in a table, metric, timestamp, hash or count.** (Prose is the only
    carve-out.)
25. **A truncated or abbreviated sequence number.** The layout yields to it.
26. **A content hash rendered in body-text colour**, smaller than the prose beside it, or
    without a copy affordance.
27. **One typographic device carrying every level of a hierarchy.**
    `text-[13px] font-medium uppercase tracking-[0.15em] text-muted-foreground` is currently the
    heading for *Context coverage*, *Recent commits*, *Current numbers*, *Needs attention*,
    *Shared context* and every group name — five semantic levels, one style, on one page.
28. **A raw ViewId printed where a label belongs** (`from brand` instead of `from Brand`).
29. **A hardcoded count that duplicates a derivable one.** `136 living documents` typed as a
    string one import away from `KINDS.length`, and `ten departments` printed beside
    `VIEWS.length === 11`.

### 13.4 Structure and layout

30. **A page declaring its own `mx-auto max-w-*`.** The shell owns the measure (§6.3).
31. **A hand-rolled page header.** `<PageHeader>` is a component, not a pattern.
32. **Two pages sharing an archetype**, or ad-hoc page-level grid CSS (§10.1).
33. **`/runs` and `/timeline` sharing a rail construction.** They are different nouns: one is a
    continuous human history, the other a set of discrete machine executions.
34. **A revision rail drawn as one full-height absolutely-positioned line.** It cannot survive
    virtualization (§9.23).
35. **A fixed column count applied to a variable-cardinality group.** Real registry groups run
    1→8 kinds; `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` gives a 1-kind group a full row with two holes.
36. **The most valuable screen in the product inside a modal.** The branch diff is a page.
37. **A `<Link><Card/></Link>` with no `h-full`, no focus ring and no press state.**
38. **A spacing value not on the 4pt scale** (§6.1).
39. **A fourth border weight** (§2.5).
40. **A layout spacer implemented as `<span className="flex-1" />`** instead of
    `justify-between`, so an action cluster lands at a different x on every card.

### 13.5 State, data and honesty

41. **Fetched and never rendered.** `event.doc`, `event.rev`, `event.branch`,
    `revisions.authorKind`, `doc.status`, `doc.onBranch`, `doc.forkedFromSeq`,
    `head.templateVersion`, `webhook.description`, `branch.mergedAt`, `member` join dates,
    `company.role`, `signal.docTitle`, `media.uploadedBy` — all currently returned and all
    currently discarded. If a query returns it, either render it or stop asking for it.
42. **A query that exists and is called by nothing.** `api.webhooks.deliveries` returns the last
    20 delivery outcomes with `httpStatus` and `error`; nothing calls it, so the UI can say a
    delivery failed and never say why.
43. **A headline number that is quietly wrong.** `committedKinds.size / KINDS.length` counts
    *distinct kinds*, so three ICP instances count as one; and `commitCount` sums across
    documents including archived ones, so `/c/[slug]` and `/c/[slug]/[view]` disagree about the
    same company.
44. **Two surfaces applying different archive filters to the same data.**
45. **An empty state that states a falsehood** — `No commits in this department yet` when the
    truth is `not in the last 200 events`.
46. **A skeleton whose geometry does not match what lands.**
47. **Two loading philosophies on one screen.**
48. **A number that animates.** No count-up, ever.
49. **A chart that re-draws on a filter change** instead of crossfading its path.
50. **A chart that interpolates across nulls.** Break the path; draw a dashed connector.
51. **A flat zero-value sparkline** where there is no data — it reads as a measured zero.
52. **A component that hides itself when empty**, so absence and zero look identical. The
    BranchPicker vanishing until the first branch exists also means the nav shifts vertically
    the first time anyone branches, and a new user is never taught branching exists.
53. **`timeAgo()` applied to a future timestamp.** Key expiry needs `<Countdown>` (§9.26).
54. **A relative time with no absolute value**, or an absolute value available only on hover.

### 13.6 Controls and interaction

55. **A raw `<select>`, `<input type="radio">` or `<input type="checkbox">`.** The most
    consequential form in the app — agent-key scope and department lanes — is currently native
    OS chrome, as is branch conflict resolution.
56. **A destructive action with no confirmation.** Revoke key, abandon branch, remove member,
    delete webhook, delete row, discard document, AI overwrite — currently all bare ghost icon
    buttons at the same visual weight as a copy button.
57. **A hover-only control**, especially a destructive one: unreachable on touch, invisible to
    keyboard.
58. **A control shaped exactly like a static chip.** The webhook active/paused toggle is a raw
    `<button>` wrapping a `<Badge>` with no hover, focus or affordance.
59. **`outline-none` with no focus-visible replacement.**
60. **A ghost button with no hover background** — a text-colour shift on a 16px glyph is not
    hit-area feedback.
61. **`transition: all` on an interactive element**, which animates layout properties on hover.
62. **`active:scale-*` baked into every button**, including full-width submits and text links.
63. **A required field with an invisible cap.** `maxLength={4000}` with no counter is a wall the
    user hits mid-sentence.
64. **A validation rule enforced by the server and not stated by the UI** — or worse, stated
    *wrongly*: `minLength={10}` alone, when the server also requires a letter and a digit, means
    ten letters passes the browser, fails the server, and reports a false cause.
65. **A one-time secret rendered in the quietest treatment on the page.**
66. **Two back affordances to the same destination with different labels.**
67. **The primary action scrolling off-screen** on a long form.
68. **A single integer wizard with only ±1 transitions** for a nine-question interview.
69. **A "Finish later" control that discards all state.** Label controls by what they do.

### 13.7 Iconography and ornament

70. **A decorative icon** (§8.2).
71. **A raw emoji** — `⚠ unconverted spend` in a codebase that otherwise uses one icon library.
72. **All twelve event types drawing the same glyph.** A merged branch, an issued key, a removed
    member and a commit are currently one grey line, while a complete `ICONS` map already exists
    privately inside `timeline/page.tsx`.
73. **A shared map living privately inside a page.** `VIEW_ICONS`, `ICONS`, `Stat`, `Metric` are
    each defined two or three times because they were never promoted to `components/`.
74. **An illustration or mascot in an empty state.**
75. **A gradient that is not a chart area fill.**
76. **`backdrop-blur` over content with nothing to blur** — it costs a compositing layer and buys
    nothing on white-on-white.
77. **The empty-tree glyph outside a version-control surface.**

### 13.8 The five that matter most

If a reviewer checks only five things, check these:

- **The ground is below and the card is above, in both modes.** (§2.6)
- **No hue on chrome; every hue on screen can be named by its job.** (§4.6)
- **Elevation is earned by objecthood, transience or leaving the flow — nothing else.** (§5.6)
- **The page's archetype is named, and no other route uses it.** (§10.1)
- **The screen is legible, complete and beautiful with zero rows of data.** (§11)
